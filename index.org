* TODO Revise objectives and components
** Goals
*** What question does my encoding answer?
- What are all of the possible traversals of the work?
  - This requires a 
- How can you determine "related" content for a given choice?

  - Example: Query choice (C7: Colin: Tell you what I told Toad)
  - "Colin will remember that" -- how many times do these choices
    actually affect future content selection?
  - Example: "Name one" -- which one would the player have named?
    (Given positive/negative opportunities)

- What significant content is present?
  - Shots (length, sequence)
  - Choices ()
  - Quick Time Events (Choices, Timing, Results)
  - Expressions (within shot)
  - Dialogue (language, timing)
  - Extradeigetic, non-choice-based Text

*** What is an example experimental design that can be conducted?
** Strategy
*** Progressive Refinement
**** Have final data structure, but don't fill in all the details
- Example: Just have the full accounting of segments and the dialogue, but not necessarily video captures
- Use this data to create a proposed SIG++ encoding of the first episode

** Schemata (Editor) -- Instead edit the schemata as JSON with functions
*** Supports Existing SIG 
*** Enables SIG++ Extensions
*** Renders Story Intention Graphs
** Content Encoding
 - Encoding Data Structure
 - Analysis of Static Data
 - Logic -- Capture All Possible Traversals

 - Captures Dialogue Acts
 - Captures Expressions, Gestures + Actions
 - Captures all static segments
 - Captures Representative Interactive Traversals
   - E.g. move from a location X to a location Y and activate
   - Variability (Shortest, Longest duration of content)
 - Captures On Screen UI/Annotations
   - Structured as Choices, Action Sets, and QT Event Indications
   - Start/Stop, Type/Color, Screen Position/Attachment

** SIG Annotation

* TODO [#A] Reread and revise Advancement Proposal
* TODO ICIDS Workshop Deadline (28 October 2016)

* Other Workshops

* Efforts
** Verify the completeness of the proposed content schema
- How?
- Demonstrate a set of concrete use cases are fulfilled through the
  schema but which are difficult or impossible otherwise.


** Create an extensible complete implementation of SIG using JSON graph format compatible with Cytoscape.jsq

** Collect the data about the first episode of the Wolf Among Us in the schema
* Short term objectives:
** Finalize set of features necessary to realize SIG Schemata
1. Logical relationships:
   1. 
2. Verify the visualization by encoding and rendering SIG Patterns in
   the "Pattern" schema enforcement, as opposed to strict enforcement.
** Record all of Episode 1 of The Wolf Among Us using editor
** What do I do with this data?
- Calculate the distribution of traversals
- Map Story Intention Graph ++
** Represent SIG data structure 
* Patterns
** Peripeteia
