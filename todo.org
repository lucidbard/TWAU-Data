* Procedure:
1. Document all of the segments, choices and variables of episode 1.
   - Show a simple visualization of the choice branching
   - Show dependency of the presence/absence of a segment on a prior variable
2. 
* Artificial Intelligence & AR / VR
- Salesforce Vision Engineering Team
- For events like dreamforce
- Smaller versions throughout the middle of the year.


- Leverage salesforce platform anyway you can
- VR/AR space

- Head mounted solutions -- great option
- Can pick and choose whatever I think is cool

Hands Free
- Haven't gotten a chance to build 

iOS
- UDID Two Builds


If the latest one if you can mount it at all.
Easier for a field service person.
Is there any kind of gesture control.


Not really a viable solution for hand alone


- Voice -- Done a lot with Alexa. Purely voice interface.
- Write it all in node. Alexa skills. Don't get raw audio, get transcription.

- Great job of translating it.
- Alexa voice service.

- Conference is starting to get worrisome how late it is.
- Talking about timeline
- A lot of other conferences coming up.
- It might be easier to work toward the other events, and an
  innovation lab where we can show off these one-off pieces.

- Don't have a particular demo in mind.
- Want to stick to some kind of field service

  - If we could move to a hands-free version of that demo.
  - A lot of times when we talk about the places that do need safety.
  - Gotta have hand controls, a lot of other challenges.

- AT the end of the day, we're trying to show things that customers
  can do with our platform.

- I can see the Seebright platform to be inexpensive enough to distribute to their field service agents.
- Another UI that looks at data from your platform

- Not trying to show off the Seebright, necessarily.

- Reseller of some sort. Looking into a Unity SDK
- Easy way to enable customers to build some kind of AR solution
- Any customer that would benefit from field service

- See if we could build a pretty simple demo.
- Walkthrough driven by a backend.

- I can pull together some of the assets I'm doing now.
  - Maybe we can group up with your team. Small condense.

- Even using a new Vuforia
- VuMark
- Sales Force demo.

- Having a set of steps animated on it


- Text
- 

;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with <f8> and enter text in its buffer.

Told him very openly on Friday where we stand.
- Was surprised we run out of money in October.
-


If based on our reading of

- Developing examples of AR content
- Enabling this AR universe
The investment pitch -- have a list of experiences that we'd like to develop


We'd like you to invest, here's 5 of them.


You have to convince people that Seebright can produce experiences
- Better have 5 glossy pages that have the graphic mockup.
