Through the use of a magic spell called Glamour, they have protected their secret community from the mundane world.
Sheriff Bigby Wolf protects them from each other.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: 105 today if you missed it, a record for the day, hottest ever in June, 103 now, and that humidity looks low, but remember the hotter the air is, the more moisture it can hold, so 103 with 31% humidity is a lot more humid than, say, 73 with 31% humidity and it is muggy out there.

=== APARTMENT ===
    [Bigby enters the building]
    BIGBY: Mr. Toad?
    [Toad, appearing as a humanoid frog, looks up the stairway] 
    TOAD: Oh shit
    [Toad turns to Bigby]
    TOAD: Bigby! Listen, mate, I know I don't look human. It's a problem, I get it, I just stepped out of the apartment for a second to see what kind of damage this drunk shit is doing.
    TOAD: Just cut me a break, yeah? I'll get me glamour first thing in the morning. Cross my heart. No need to kick up a fuss.
    * [I'm looking at a 3 foot toad.]
        BIGBY: I'm looking at a 3 foot toad in a sweater. That's a problem.
    * [Enough excuses, Toad.]
        BIGBY: I've heard enough of your excuses Toad, this is unacceptable. 
    * (no_harm_done) [No harm done.]
        BIGBY: Look, no harm done, I'll give you a pass, but listen, <>
    * [...] 
        [BIGBY is silent, staring at Toad]
        TOAD: Come on Bigby, say something. You're starting to scare me.
- BIGBY: If you can't afford to look human, you're going to The Farm. It's as simple as that. {no_harm_done:
    ? "True!"}
    TOAD: You can't send me up to live with those animals..."
    [Bigby gives Mr. Toad a look]
    TOAD: You know what I mean.
    BIGBY: Go see a witch. Get a glamour."
    TOAD: Bigby, they're bleedin' me dry, mate. The quality of the spell goes down, but the rates keep climbing up. Do you have any idea how much it costs to have an entire family in glamour?

    * I don't make the rules
    BIGBY: I don't make the rules, sorry. I can't give you a free pass on this, my hands are tied. There's too much at stake.
    [Toad looks downcast]
    TOAD: Right, right.
    BIGBY: There's too much at stake. 
    * [Get it fixed.]
        BIGBY: Then get it fixed. It's not complicated, Toad. 
    * Not my problem
        BIGBY: It's not my problem. You're the one risking your entire family getting shipped off. It's completely irresponsible, Toad.
        TOAD: Bigby, please, that's a low blow. All of this will be taken care of as soon as the witches are available to cast the spell. 
    * ...
        TOAD: It's not even really worth dwelling on at this point, you're telling me to get it together.
- BIGBY: Whatever it costs, it's worth it. You don't want me catching you out of glamour again. 
[You hear a loud crash from upstairs]
    TOAD: Fuckin hell.
    TOAD: See? This is what I called you about, Sheriff.
    TOAD: You gonna stand there? Do something, Bigby. Before he completely tears up the place.

    * [So what have I walked into?]
    BIGBY: So... what am I walking into exactly?
    TOAD: Woodsman is on another bender, he's been going on like that for hours, turn this place into dust if you let him. He's in a fucking rage.
    [WOODSMAN GRUNTS AND ANOTHER CRASH]
    * [What do you want me to do?]
        BIGBY: And what exactly do you want me to do?"
        TOAD: I want you to throw the fuckin' Woodsman out of here. Drunk shitâ€¦ He's been going on like that for hours. Turn this place to dust if you let him. He's in a fuckin' rage.
        [WOODSMAN GRUNTS UPSTAIRS]
        TOAD: This is the last straw, Bigby. He has to go!

        TOAD: Oh, thanks for that Bigby, you're a real gentleman.
- TOAD: This is the last straw, Bigsby, he has to go.
    * [Do it yourself.]
        BIGBY: You're the landlord, this is something you should be doing.
        TOAD: Oh, yeah, that'd be a fair fight. You're the sheriff, Bigby, and the man is clearly disturbing the peace, or whatever a mundy cop would call it. Wait, you're not worried about his axe, are you? I know you two have history, but.
        BIGBY: I'm not worried.
        TOAD: Right, of course.
    * [Why's he so pissed?]
        BIGBY: So, what set him off?
        TOAD: Who knows what it was this time. Man's got a hair trigger. I avoid him as much as possible.
        BIGBY: When did he start drinking?
        TOAD: Not sure he ever stopped.
    * [I'm heading up.] 
    BIGBY: Fine, I'm heading up. Get. Your. Glamour.

BIGBY gives her a look.
FAITH: That wasn't intentional... sorry.
FAITH looks waay while smoking, with her back turned to BIGBY. Her eyes look scared.
BIGBY: How much was it he owed you?
FAITH: A hundred...
BIGBY: ...and I'm guessing it'd be bad for you to show up empty handed!
FAITH turns toward him and provides a smile.
FAITH: I'll be fine.

 * \[give her some money\]
BIGBY: Let's see. I've got, uh... It's twenty, forty... seven-- eight. Fifty eight. It's all I got -- it'll help, right? 
BIGBY holds out the money.
BIGBY: Take it.
FAITH: It's okay. I'll be fine. You've done enough. Really.
BIGBY's expression is hard.
BIGBY: Just... take the money, okay?

BIGBY: Meet me back at my office then.
FAITH: It's a little late for an office visit, Sheriff. I'll swing by your apartment.
BIGBY: How do you know where I...
FAITH: You live in the smallest apartment in The Woodlands. Everyone knows that.
BIGBY: Good to know.
FAITH: You should get cleaned up. You look like shit. And I don't use that term lightly.
FAITH: Some of these look pretty bad.

 * [Tell me what you really think.]
 * [That's harsh.]
 * [I clean up okay.]
BIGBY: I clean up okay.
FAITH: I'll believe it when I see it.

- FAITH: Hey... I need to tell you something.
BIGBY: What is it?
FAITH leans close and says the following into his ear with her hand on his shoulder:
