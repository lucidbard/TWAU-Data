*** Abstract
This paper describes a planned study to use a model of the narrative
meaning to analyze a contemporary interactive digital narrative. The
primary research question is whether a model of the underlying story
can predict player emotional responses to key events within an
interactive narrative when provided with a player's earlier
choices. The game /The Wolf Among Us/ by Telltale Games was selected
due to both its critically acclaimed status and the fact that it has
both a strong, stable narrative and rich emotional content tied
directly to the story itself. The combination of sophisticated
narrative and high production values provides an opportunity to
understand how choices and branching stories operate within
contemporary digital narratives. The game uses choice menus with
natural language labels with simplistic accounting of inventory and
environments. The games uses bespoke hand authorship of complex
well-rounded characters and on dramatic voice and animated
performances, representing highly layered meanings and attracting
fervent fan communities.  We selected an existing computational model
of narrative for its ability to represent affective relationship
between story-values and the character goal networks that pursue them
(David Elson's Story Intention Graph and its text-focused annotation
tool, /Scheherazade/ \cite{Elson2012}) and plan to use annotated
adaptations of traversals to compare player experiences. This paper
describes the proposed efforts to pursue the aforementioned research
question: first, developing a repeatable methodology for annotating a
cinematic choice-based adventure using the selected narrative model
(SIG) and in particular associating events with story values and
characters. Second, recording a set of player's emotional experiences
while playing the game, and using the method developed in the first
effort to associate these responses with configurations of the story
content. Third, developing an algorithm whose input is the player's
traversal and whose output are potential places for emotional
response. Fourth, a second study validating the algorithm which is
conducted using episode 2 of /The Wolf Among Us/.
*** Outline
**** Introduction
Interactive storytelling uses the capabilities of computational media
to dynamically assemble stories based on player input and/or on an
underlying simulation of a world.

This paper is organized as follows: First, we motivate the research
question and situated its goals within game studies and the
computational narratology.

***** Motivation
Interactive narratives are challenging to study: they present a
constantly moving target for analysis, as each traversal (a term
introduced by to describe a specific playthrough) still in their
infancy.

This work builds on the ongoing efforts within the computational
narratology community, especially those focused on corpora and formal
models.

Narrative can be understood as phenomenon that arises from the
coordination of inherent mental abilities, including the ability to
understand the interaction of agents, their goals, and beliefs and the
sequence of causally related events they are involved in
\citep{Ryan2015b}.

In the field of Computational Narratology, Mark Finlaysen conducted a
study of the use of corpora that observes that text[fn:3], is prioritized
given the availability of tools \cite{Finlayson2013}, although the
only game logs that he cited were those of Orkin in the game EAT & RUN
\cite{Orkin2010}.

The literature does not, however, provide an example of a corpus of a
modern interactive narrative game in a format suitable for annotation,
nor does it detail an effort to map an existing model of computational
narratives onto a pre-existing long-form interactive digital
narrative work.

David Elson intended the /Story Intention Graph/ to be a descriptive
model of meaning, representing the mental simulation that naturally
takes place of agents, their pursuit of goals and resulting causally
linked events that make up those pursuits.

In the next section, we'll briefly define the subset of narratives
that fall in Tanenbaum's /readerly/ pleasure.


***** Cinematic choice-based adventure (CCBA) games
Telltale Game's /The Wolf Among Us/ was released in 2013 for multiple
platforms.

It is useful to locate the specific space that the subgenre of
cinematic choice-based adventure games occupies: where story content
is coded to be presented to the player in a very specific order and
under very specific conditions and where virtually no unexpected
sequence of content occurs.[fn:9]

The adventure game genre is often put in opposition to genres which
promote more player freedom, such as in Massively Multiplayer Role
Playing Games (MMORPGs) or Open World RPGs which allow players to
create and develop their own character.

/The Wolf Among Us/ is episodic: future episodes must account for
selected previous player decisions, although these are usually limited
to decisions that have an ontological effect on the world (including
the memories of the characters).

Games in this subgenre conserve content and maximizing narrative
payoffs among all possible traversals, this subgenre is ideally suited
to annotation using SIG, as the player's goals and intentions are
rewarded for small perturbations while the story remains relatively
consistent.
**** Story Intention Graphs
The Story Intention Graph (SIG) schemata were developed by David Elson
as a set of discourse relations to represent key relationships among
concepts such as goals, values and agents present in textual
narratives using concepts from narrative theory.

Elson found that the SIG schemata, even without representing
individual propositions, was more successful than alternative methods
at identifying similarities in the stories.

The lack of contemporary narrative games as the source of annotated
datasets is further exacerbated by the popularity within the fields of
narrative generation and understanding for using simple stories such
as Aesop's fables.

The proposed study requires the development of new methodology.

**** Methodology and Study Design
The proposed study requires the development of new methodology.
1. Select and adapt narrative model to represent relationships between
   events and decisions and the gameplay itself.
2. Use the model to annotate a set of "natural" traversals of users
   who also report emotional events.
3. Analyze the emotional content with respect to story structure.
4. Use these results to iterate on the model, annotation process and
   to determine if these are predictive or indicative of underlying
   story-influenced emotional responses.

***** Using a Model to Annotate Narrative Structure
First, the narrative structure needs to be available for annotation.

1. It be in a text format, given availability of SIG annotation software
2. Be capable of adding additional traversal content without redoing
   deleting or altering previous traversal positions. This would allow
   comparison amongst traversals where if one traversal referred to a
   piece of content it would be at the same position as a separate
   one.

We began with the scope of the first episode, using as a source what
we are calling a "natural traversal."

***** Computational Narratology - Mani, Inderjeet
For computational accounts to be made more relevant to humanities
narratology, two issues need to be confronted: (a) the challenge of
interdisciplinary communication across substantial methodological
divides, especially given the shift in interest of post-classical
narratology away from the precise analyses that characterized its
structuralist phase; (b) the fact that computational representations
and techniques for story generation are not general enough to concoct
anything other than very short, relatively simple stories (such as
fairy tales), let alone epics or novels (Gervás et al. 2006).

More nuanced models of characters’ emotions have also been
explored. For example, the interactive storytelling system of Pizzi
(2011) is driven by plans that exploit an inventory of characters’
feelings listed in Flaubert’s preliminary studies for Madame
Bovary; such a framework allows for a variety of sentiment-driven
interactive retellings of the novel. Another interesting reformulation
of a narratological construct is that of suspense. Cheong (2007)
generates stories judged to be suspenseful by modeling the reader’s
reasoning about limitations and conflicts involving a protagonist’s
goals (Prince → Reader [7]), based on narratologica

* INT Outline
We present a methodology and results of encoding playthroughs of an
existing interactive narrative in such a way as to be modeled using
existing models of story. Modeling interaction, engagement, player
response and story content are increasingly important as AI methods
improve in using labeled and unlabeled datasets to determine
underlying models and relationships. The present study focuses on
emotional engagement and player choices, drawing from theories of
choice poetics and dramatic situation analysis and discussing the
results of creating a format amenable to existing models of linear
narrative, demonstrating the suitability for nonlinear narratives of a
particular complexity.


** Motivations
1. Contemporary interactive narratives are not currently used as
   objects of academic study at the level of computational models.
2. This means that many of the design advances made by authors of such
   platforms and narratives are out of scope for works that purport to
   advance the state of the art, leading to a disconnect between where
   generation of interactive narratives currently is and where the
   contemporary capabilities are. This gap is evident in the ratio of
   hand-crafted content vs generative content. See Prom Week, Versu,
   Facade, etc.
3. The state of the art in story understanding systems is unable to
   work with non-linear narratives.
4. Current models of story are divorced from actual player experiences
   as measured in empirical experiments or actual readings.
5. Planning-based approches are unable to account for the non-logical
   additive and nonlocal effect of cumulative information presented in
   rich multimedia stories such as those produced by Telltale Games.
6. Hypermedia approaches do not account for works authored outside of
   a hypermedia model of authorship.
7. Text Encoding Initiative and the Amsterdam Hypermedia Model exclude
   logical relationships and models of the underlying story that
   define the reception of the content. Also, TEI focuses on textual
   documents, such as scripts, and not on dynamic works, whereas
   Amsterdam Hypermedia Model ....
8. What does a complex workflow offer that a branching storygraph
   would not? -- a means of comparing player experiences to one
   another and to identify commonalities and constants in the
   underlying narrative as compared to variations based on choices.
- What would serve as a good baseline?
- What is the current state of the art?
- Who else is pursuing these goals?
- Why are these goals important?

** Goals
1. Describe the relationship amongst an interactive story's underlying
   model, its choice structure and the player's individual emotionally
   charged experience.
2. To chart and visualize player's desires, choices, expectations and
   exposure and reception of information through an experience of an
   interactive story.

** Research Questions:
1. Why do choice-based cinematic narratives trigger strong emotions?
2. How do you measure and contextualize player response to a
   storygame?
3. What are meaningful ways to compare enriched traversal records of a
   storygame when the content differs?
4. Does a model of the underlying story increase the value for
   predicting player responses to narratives, as compared to
   alternative methods?
5. How do you measure story understanding for a nonlinear story?
   1. Which aspects or elements remain constant? Which aspects vary?

** Contribution of present paper (ICIDS)
*** Describe the methodology for recording, encoding and mapping player experience of interactive narrative
 - Encoding: To take an existing nontextual interactive story and to
   reify it in a way amenable to computational methods. In particular,
   to select a structure and annotate it with layers of meaningful
   information contained in the artifact as playable.
** Applications and Future Work
 - Player modeling for assessment of narrative design could improve
   the evaluation of generated narratives.
 - A computational model of interactive narratives would allow
   researchers to begin addressing new questions about the works that
   are otherwise impossible.

* User Replay Reports
I first completed A Wolf Among Us a month ago. After doing a few other
things, these past few weeks I've been replaying the game a ton,
trying different approaches to see if I can find anything new. I don't
know how many times the average TWAU player plays the game, and since
the game is almost two years old, it could be that everything I've
discovered is common knowledge. But I thought it'd be fun to talk
about what I've found.  During one playthrough, I went through the
game picking the silence option every chance I could. I call this my
"Strong, Silent Wolf" playthrough. If you haven't done it, do so. It's
hilarious. It seems like Bigby randomly decides to troll people by not
answering him. Or that he has a curse on him that'll makes it so he
can only say a certain number of words per day, so he has to be
selective. It's not always as awkward as you might think, because the
characters already know Bigby, and seem to be able to guess what he's
thinking, or they realize that they need to keep the conversation
moving. Normally it doesn't result in new dialogue, but there are
exceptions. If you don't answer Snow at the beginning of episode 2,
she eventually gets pissed that you won't confide at her. If you
refuse to answer Beast when he asks you if you've seen Beauty, you get
this hilarious bit where he says "Motherfucker...!" as the elevator
doors close. If you don't answer Beauty while investigating the hotel
room, she'll get annoyed and ask how Snow puts up with it. If you
refuse to tell Snow why you interrupted Lily's funeral, she'll tell
you that she doesn't have time for your "lost boy at the mall"
routine. If you don't answer Mary at the foundry, she'll ask you if
you're trying to "eyeball" her to death.  During that playthrough, I
also failed as many QTEs as I could, and I found a couple of
interesting things. In episode 3, if you grapple with Dee for his
shotgun and fail, it'll discharge and the bullets will nick Snow
across the neck. It's not mentioned in dialogue, but for the next
couple of episodes she has a bandage across one part of her neck, and
a stitched up wound below it. If you don't hit Q fast enough when
Vivian trys to drive you into a wall in episode 5, it knocks Bigby out
and he wakes up an hour later. When he goes to the club, Vivian has
killed herself. I was disappointed to find out that this happens if
you jump on The Crooked Man's car, because I thought I had found a
variation few other people would be aware of.  The interrogation scene
is fun to toy around with. You can get two answers from the suspect by
hitting them. After that, they'll stop talking, and Ichabod and
Bluebeard will tell you to try a different approach. You can keep
hitting them, but eventually the option disappears. It's fun to pulp
their faces as much as you can, even if it's pointless. If you're
trying to torment them as much as possible, then with Tweedledee
you'll end with two violent interrogation methods unused, and with the
Woodsman one, since he doesn't have any money for you to steal.  One
thing I think is neat about the first episode is that the dialogue you
hear when examining Toad's apartment varies depending on what order
you few the objects. I think that every two possible combinations have
unique dialogue. In a similar vein, the dialogue varies depending on
what order you view the evidence in Room 207, and where you find the
envelope depends on what you examine last.  Replaying the game as made
me realize something about Telltale's choice system. You get those
"The character will remember that" messages, but sometimes you need to
pick a particular dialogue option to see any variation. For example,
with Aunty Greenleaf you only see any effect from your interactions
with Rachel if you pick the option to ask her why she chose to
disguise herself as a child. If you pick the most playful dialogue
options, she'll comment that Bigby was good with her. If you pick the
aggressive options, she'll say that not many people would be willing
to strongarm a child. I'm not sure that seeing those messages insures
that you can find some variation. TJ and Nerissa have several of those
messages, and I don't think I've noticed any variation in their
dialogue. Sometimes you get additional dialogue options if you pick a
certain response. If you tell Snow White that you have no doubt that
Crane is the killer, you get several options where you can explain why
you think that. I've also noticed that usually the moments where you
get a "The character will remember that" are activated by picking any
of the possible responses, while sometimes you only get that if you
pick one particular response, like telling Beast "Not now" at the
start of episode 3 or telling Bluebeard that he's not needed in the
investigation.  As an aside, if you're looking to make Bigby the
biggest bastard possible, I'd recommend going to Crane's apartment in
episode 3 instead of the Tweedle's office, because although you can
beat up Jack, you can't beat up Flycatcher. In episode 4 I'd recommend
going to the Pawn Shop first instead of The Butcher's, because The
Butcher plays out largely the same either way, while visiting the Pawn
Shop gives you the opportunity to abuse Toad and Jack. You also get
the option to tell Johann that you nearly killed the Jersey Devil,
which alters his dialogue in the meatlocker scenes.  On the topic of
choices. How Telltale handles their choices is a big point of
contention. Proponents argue that it's not about changing the story,
it's about shaping the characters. I've seen a few people who said
they thought TWAU did Telltale's style of choices better than their
other games, because it really does feel like it's more about shaping
Bigby than influencing the story. I'd have to agree with that. For the
most part, the game isn't about big moral choice as it is deciding
whether you want to be the Big Bad Wolf, or the Great Good Wolf. Also,
I doubt anyone expects every choice to have big consequences, but
certain choices really should logically affect the trajectory of the
story, and it's up to the writers to provide a good explanation for
why they don't. I feel like TWAU didn't really have many of those kind
of choices, and I rarely felt pulled out of the story by the game
going against my choices. You're also given several legitimate options
on how to approach your investigation, which gives the game some
replayability. There were a few things I think could've been done
better.  I was hoping that treating Tweedledee nicely in the
interrogation would've had some future effect. I know Dee isn't the
kind of person to go against his boss, but I would've liked having a
couple of scenes where instead of threatening Bigby, he genuinely
tries to get him to back off because he doesn't want to hurt him. I
was annoyed when the game has Crane dispose of Lily's body even if you
tell her she can have it. Character wise, it makes sense that Crane
would want to get rid of Lily's body before anyone can examine it
further, but it's still a bit annoying because allowing Holly to give
Lily a proper send off wouldn't affect the rest of the story.  I feel
the trial scene could've been done better. I was looking forward to
seeing the characters acknowledge my choices, and I hoped they'd take
my overall attitude into account and not just my big choices. But if
you make good choices, you don't hear about the things you did right,
you just don't hear about the decisions you did wrong. One exception
is Aunty Greenleaf. If you burn her tree, she's pissed at both of
you. If you just walk away, she'll still be upset that you threatened
to do it. If you give her a job, she'll be angry at Snow, but grateful
to Bigby.  How the scene plays out if you kill The Crooked Man is even
more problematic. It makes sense if you've made the worst choices, but
not much if you haven't. Gren approves of you killing Crooked Man, but
complains that you ripped his arm off. Perfectly reasonable. If you
haven't, he complains that you knocked him around the bar, even though
in most cases he attacked you first. A certain dialogue option has
Beast complain that you nearly gouged his eyes out, even though,
again, he attacked you first. Unlike in the other scenario, Aunty
Greenleaf is pissed at you even if you offered her a job. Granted, it
makes sense that the characters wouldn't want to give Bigby much
leeway when he walks in carrying a dead body, but I think making the
player feel like their choices mattered is more important. The bright
side to the characters having selective memory is that it makes the
option to walk out of the trial so much more satisfying, because Bigby
basically calls them all ungrateful assholes and tells them to go fuck
themselves.  Thoughts? Questions? Ever wondered what would happen if
you picked a certain option? It's possible I've done it.
** ---

I'm curious about your choices and why you made them. I'm thinking mostly major choices in the game but anything that was meaningful to you I'm interested in as well. Or if you don't think you can narrow it down to single choices, how did you play as Bigby overall, mean-hearted, good-hearted, witty, silent?
I'm just very curious because I've played through the game a couple times now and I noticed that my perspectives on Bigby (and some of the other charaters) changed based how I chose to play.

I liked to roleplay Bigby as an angry, cruel guy trying to be good. So he was good, giving Faith money, not burning down Greenleaf's tree etc. but in the heat of the moment he used violence and intimidation because of his instincts, ripping off Gren's arm, killing Dum, slamming the Butcher etc.

I spared Dum because I thought it would give me pull with the twins later on, like they'd come through for me or something when I needed it... but nope. I bet that it isn't any different if you kill him. That feels like it should have been a much bigger decision given how big a role the Tweedles played in the first half of the season.

Up until (and including) the interrogation scene I played Bigby as angry, because I was livid about Faith and Snow "dying". I also rather enjoyed being the Big Bad Wolf a little too much. However, after Snow's return the anger subsided somewhat and I realised I was being a bit of a dick. I didn't rip Glen's arm off, but man I was tempted. I felt guilty enough for considering it, I can't imagine the guilt of seeing him armless in Episode 2 in the scene at the Trip Trap. For the remainder of the game I was more sympathetic to the citizens of Fabletown, but I primarily focused on getting justice for Faith (and Lily, but mostly Faith).

I started played as a good person like in The Walking Dead (which I ended the day before), but then I realized "Hey, I'm the fucking Big Bad Wolf, let's play like that". I couldn't for two reasons: Bigby's Mercy (as it's shown in the Book of Fables) and Snow. I wanted to do the best for the Bigby and Snow relationship (except burning the Greenleaf's tree, that was excessive). Well, I think I have explained myself. And, after reading Fables, I think Bigby would have do what I did.

I know I'm late to the party but I still like to answer because I'm bored and it's a neat idea.
Generally I tried to play as I usually play, I try to be calm and collected, reasonable and logical and giving others a chance, but when others test my patience to an unreasonable degree I did use intimidation.
But I'll just go through all the "major" choices (the one the games lists).
In Episode 1 I gave Faith money, because why not? Just trying to be nice and it didn't seem like Bigby is really the person who needs a lot. When it comes to Beauty, I told her that I didn't care about her situation if she doesn't want to explain it but I also didn't tell Beast that I saw her, not because I wanted to do Beauty a favor, but because I didn't want to get into it, so whatever.
I did go to Toad's apartment first after his call since it sounded much more urgent than Lawrence who looked dead through the mirror. So I couldn't prevent his death.
When it comes to prime suspects I didn't tell Snow anything since I really wasn't sure at this point and none of the given answers made sense to me. Lawrence killed himself because he hurt Faith, plus it seemed like he was trying to kill himself for like a week or whatever. The Woodsman... I dunno it was just obvious to me that he didn't do it, he may have been an a** when you first meet him but he just wasn't the type. Tweedle Dee/Dum also wouldn't have made sense since they were investigating the murder themselves. Bluebeard would've just been way too obvious because his fable entry said he used to decapitate his wives. I also didn't suspect Georgie since I assumed that her pimp would probably be more protective about "his employee" and I didn't knew anything about him.
And at the end I decided to go after Tweedle Dee since the Woodsman obviously didn't do anything. Also I didn't rip of Grendels arm since I would never maim someone like that without a damn good reason.
In Episode 2 I sympathized with Crane, because while he was a jerk I did believe that he really did care about Fabletown and Snow and during the interrogation I was nice to Tweedle Dee and got him to talk with a few well placed questions, it seemed more reasonable to discuss this like Gentlemen without any violence. I also didn't hit Georgie or smashed any of his stuff, though he really really tested my patience and he was lucky Bigby found the floor safe when he did. And I also didn't hit Beast while he was down because I wanted the fight to be over since it was a waste of time.
In Episode 3 I didn't interrupt Snow because I didn't see any direct urgency in telling her about my findings, though I was worried the "moment of silence" would last forever. Later I investigated Cranes Apartment at first and did make a deal with Jack, also as a side note, I actually appreciated Bluebeards help even if I didn't have the option to express it, though nothing ever came out of it. I also didn't check the office after I was done at the apartment but went to the Trip Trap.
I did not burn Greenleaf's tree, though it was a tough choice for me, but it just didn't seem right and I didn't like Snow bossing me around.
When it came to Tweedle Dum... it probably was "out of character" for me and I regretted it a bit, but I did kill him. I was just sick of the Tweedles with their stupid smiles, stupid lines and stupid attitude, they've been a pain since Episode 1 and I felt like the whole situation was a life or death battle (which it was). It just really came natural to me, hesitating only for a second.
In Episode 4 at the start I was really split about Colin, at first I told him that he should go to the farm since the rules are the rules, but then he told me that that's not true and I bended the rules all the time for others, which reminded me of how I let Jack go for example. Colin actually changed my mind here and I restarted the game to tell him that he can stay. Plus I really appreciated him defending me in front of Snow. And I know this may be kind of cheating since I didn't "live with my choice", but fu** it.
I didn't attempt to remove Nerissas Ribbon because she was visibly freaked out about it and I didn't see any reason to try to do it. I mean I understood that it was the source of the spell that kept her from talking, but since Nerissa was so adamantly against removing it I suspected something bad would happen and there should be a better way.
For investigation I went to the Butchers shop, the Lucky Pawn didn't seem to be in any danger to run away. About Toad, I told him that I try to let him stay, though I was a bit confused that I was never given the option to give him money for the glamour, especially since I confistated a huge bundle of money in Cranes apartment earlier (just as a note, this was the only time I ever took money because I assumed Crane wouldn't return anyway.)
When I met the Crooked Man I agreed to talk to him first, because I consider myself a reasonable person and gladly accept any invitation to talk something through, plus I wanted to give the Crooked Man a genuine chance.
In Episode 5 I did kill Georgie because he was in such pain and he seemed dead anyway. Plus it was a little bit of statisfaction because he really tested my patience all the time.
As for the Crooked Man, I did bring him back alive, because as I said I'm a reasonable man and gladly accept any invitation to talk things through and I was genuinly interested in his side of the story and arguments. So I guess I don't have to mention that I gave him a fair trial and the chance to speak.
As for the Crooked Mans punishment, well it was a tough choice for me. Killing him wasn't really a choice for me, though I did realize that it was kind of unfair for me to kill Dum and let the Crooked Man live, but that was during the heat of a battle and this would've been cold blooded when alternatives exist. I did consider throwing him down the Witching Well because it seemed like the most appropiate thing, but this also really didn't sit well with me. So I had Aunty Greenleaf imprison him and was very statisfied with that result, though I didn't really like that they took out his tounge since he should be given a second chance one day.
TJs gift to Snow I did accept, because seriously why not? It's such a trivial thing to do anyway.
And my last words to Nerissa were "I hope I've done some good here" because I really wasn't that sure about it.
Also I didn't attempt to chase after Nerissa, I just let her go because this was obviously what she wanted, otherwise she would've looked back or not leave with all her bags.
And while I'm at it I give a very quick rundown on how my relationship with certain characters were in no particular order and only the "major" ones:
Snow - I actually didn't like her that much, yeah she had some genuine sweet moments but she was often pretty unfair, like whenever she said something like "Try to be nice" I could just tell myself "Fu** you, I've been nothing but nice so far!"...
Toad - To be honest I didn't really care for him.
Crane - I wanted to believe that he had a sincere interest in having Fabletown be a good place for everyone, but he disappointed me.
Georgie - He tested my patience the most out of all characters.
Crooked Man - I actually really liked him but I was disappointed everytime he send his goons after me. Though it was frustrating to hear his "I just gave the order!" defense and while he presented himself as a benefactor for poor Fables his actions spoke volumes against that. So he was just disappointing in that regard as well, he was no Illusive Man, that was sure...
Tweedles - I really disliked them, they were a huge pain, constantly interrupting the investigation, having a shi**y attitude and these weird stupid smiles.
Woodsman - He turned out to be a real bro and kind of a woobie, I like him.
Colin - After the first encounter I didn't like him at all, but him defending Bigby made me change my mind about him. He's a honest but loyal friend.
Beauty - While she's kind of cute she's also incredibly annoying, it felt like she constantly tried to push her problems onto me and make it about herself, plus she seems to love playing capting obvious, repeating everything that has already been said during the investigation of room 207.
Beast - He seemed like a genuinly nice guy, though he has some serious issues.
Holly - I somehow couldn't bring myself to really care for her at all...
Grendel - Kind of disliked him at first, but I felt that I kind of earned his respect during the game and that made me respect and appreciate him more.
Bluebeard - I actually liked Bluebeard, well I didn't like his tendencies for violence, but I did respect him and appreciated his help. I did believe that he sincerely wanted to get this case solved and help out and that he just wanted to "get it done".
Bufkin - He was kind of annoying, but also helpful, so he was easy to tolerate.
Nerissa/Vivian/Lily/Faith - Honestly... didn't really care about them at all.
Bloody Mary - I was really annoyed by her attitude, but I can't deny she has some sort of coolness factor and I respect her power as a fable.
Greenleaf - Only want to say that her child-disguise was incredibly paper thin... like as soon as the door opened and I saw a child I was like "Yep, that's her, glamouring it up or whatever" and everything she says just sounded kind of fake and her comments while investigating the room made it painfully obvious.
Oh well, ramble over, 10k limit almost full. Was fun talking about it.

I have yet to play through a second time, but when I play Telltale games I try to immerse myself in the character and make it my own. I analyze the circumstances and make choices based on what the real me would to in that position. Whenever I fail an action command sequence or accidentally pick the wrong option, I chalk that kind of thing to "poor reflexes" and "Freudian slip." I never backtrack unless I get a Game Over screen.
So generally I tried to be good, but there were times when I lost my temper. It may not be much to write home about, but the first playthrough told Bigby's story through my perspective, and that made the story more engaging for me.
On a side note, I think I'll do what I did with TWD season 1 by playing a second file doing everything completely opposite :P

My policy throughout the game was: "Talk shit, get hit". Worked out well. Moterfucker didn't need his head anyway.

I'm usually pretty lawful-good in video games. When I accidentally went too far with Jorgy when breaking stuff I felt guilty and instant replayed to avoid tearing of Grin's arm. However, I still broke Crane's nose on every play through. And I think it's mostly because he was so bitchy to me in the beginning of the game.

In games like this, I usually play as a "good" character, but Telltale games are so good I create two saves. Save #1 is my "regular" play through, where I'm always trying to help people. Save #2 is my sociopath save, where I'll reload over and over, purely for the sake of exploration.
I gave Faith money (really, who didn't?) because no one should have to resort to what she did for money. I gave Colin the drink, considering the debts I owe him from back in the Homelands. I brought the Crooked Man in for a trial for two reasons. Firstly, I wanted Snow's approval, seeing as how she is my boss. Secondly, most of the plot's drama came to be because of the previous administration's corruption. If I cut corners or took shortcuts in the name of "justice," then I wasn't much better than Crane.

I tried to follow on Snow's instructions mostly, but sometimes got out of control. Something that I noticed is that when there's no exact option of what you'd really like to do, instead of letting that ruining immersion I liked to make excuses. Like, I can't "confiscate money and put it in Snow's desk ASAP" (I didn't see that option at least), so I made little excuses in his head: hey, this money shouldn't stay here at the pawn shop in Crane's coat, but of course I'm not gonna use it for myself, it'll go back to Fabletown someday.

Tried to be good and didn't let things go too far usually. I killed the Tweedle because I can claim self-defense. I destroyed a bit of Georgie's property when pushed. I told the Crooked Man that I would bring him in, and the game didn't give me an option to betray him, so he went to trial. I wasn't sure if I wanted to throw him down the well or not, but when he suddenly attacked right at the end, I decided that imprisoning him would be the better punishment.

I chose based on my own moral compass, so I ended up killing Georgie and imprisoning the Crooked Man.

** Verify the completeness of the proposed content schema
- How?
- Demonstrate a set of concrete use cases are fulfilled through the
