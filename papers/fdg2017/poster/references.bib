  abstract = "Narratives provide a powerful means of making sense of our world.
              They are cognitive tools that we use to examine and shape
              ourselves, as well as the environment around us. Every day, we
              seek out and tell stories to reflect on our past, navigate our
              present, and direct our future. Because narratives embed the
              complexity of the universe as we know it, it is challenging to
              develop a complete representation of narrative meaning. Some
              proposed theories focus on the perceptions and interactions of
              narrative agents. Others emphasize the communicative impact that
              a narrative has on its audience. Many more interpretations have
              been explored, but relatively little work exists that seeks to
              reconcile these multiple definitions and applications of
              narrative. Narrative models may reflect more about their creators
              and their unique scenarios than the elusive tangles of meaning
              they are meant to capture. They are, after all, stories we are
              telling about stories. Each presents a lens in which to view, and
              subsequently define, narrative for a particular context.
              Regardless, perhaps we can learn from these diverse perspectives.
              Their congruence illuminates key features of story, while their
              discrepancies progressively carve out the rich, explorable space
              of all possible narratives. Although we may never reach the
              boundaries of that space, our explorations could give rise to new
              insights in narrative understanding.This thesis seeks to
              determine whether we can devise a framework that can usefully
              encode multiple narrative representations in a human-readable
              format. To do so would promote annotation, comparison, and
              sharing of narrative data among researchers. Further, a framework
              that can express distinct narrative representations should also
              reveal methods for automatically transforming their fundamental
              units. I will provide examples for how this type of adaptation
              may be useful for personalizing human-computer interaction
              scenarios which rely on narrative structures.",

              analysis and model checking of games to the literature on formal
              software verification via Buchi ¨automata. We show how to define
              desirable or undesirable sequences of game events with Playspecs
              and how associated algorithms can find examples (or prove the
              impossibility) of such sequences. Playspecs have two main
              benefits over existing techniques for specifying the behaviors of
              a game over time. First, they offer a scalable commitment to
              formal modeling: the same Playspecs can filter existing traces
              gathered by telemetry, search for satisfying traces using
              existing game code, or drive formal verification when paired with
              a logical model of a game. Second, Playspecs’ syntax can be
              customized for the game engine or game in question so designers
              may write specifications using their game’s native vocabulary. We
              define Playspecs’ syntax and semantics (modulo gamespecific
              customizations) and outline algorithms for each of the

              narrative discourse. Al- though narratives of all kinds are
              ubiquitous in daily life, contemporary text processing techniques
              typically do not leverage the aspects that separate narrative
              from expository discourse. We describe two approaches to the
              problem. The first approach considers the conversational networks
              to be found in literary fiction as a key aspect of discourse
              coher- ence; by isolating and analyzing these networks, we are
              able to comment on longstanding literary theories. The second
              approach proposes a new set of discourse relations that are
              specific to narrative. By focusing on certain key aspects, such
              as agentive characters, goals, plans, beliefs, and time, these
              relations represent a theory-of-mind interpretation of a text. We
              show that these discourse relations are expressive, formal,
              robust, and through the use of a software system, amenable to
              corpus collection projects through the use of trained annotators.
              We have procured and released a collection of over 100 encodings,
              covering a set of fables as well as longer texts including
              literary fiction and epic poetry. We are able to inferentially
              find similarities and analogies between encoded stories based on
              the proposed relations, and an evaluation of this technique shows
              that human raters prefer such a measure of similarity to a more

              used in computational and cognitive research on narrative to
              date? What are the general characteristics of these corpora, and

              questions, I conducted a wide-ranging literature review,
              collecting a bibliography of over 2600 conference papers, journal

  abstract = "This dissertation aims at positioning adventure games in game
              studies, by describing their formal aspects and how they have
              integrated game design with stories. The adventure game genre
              includes text adventures (also known as interactive fiction),
              graphical text adventures, and graphic adventures, also referred
              to as point-and-click adventure games. Adventure games have been
              the first videogames to evidence the difficulty of reconciling
              games and stories, an already controversial topic in game
              studies. An adventure game is a simulation, the intersection
              between the rule system of the game and its fictional world. The
              simulation becomes a performance space for the player. The
              simulation establishes how the player can interact with the world
              of the game. The simulated world integrates a series of
              concatenated puzzles, which structure the performance of the
              player. Solving the puzzles thus means advancing in the story of
              the game. The integration of the story with the simulation is
              done through the performance of the player. The game design
              establishes a specific set of actions necessary to complete both
              the game and the story, and this set of actions constitutes a
              behavior that must be restored through performance. The player
              can also explore the world and its workings, which is necessary
              to solve the puzzles. By solving the puzzles, the player restores
              this pre-set behavior. The simulation in adventure games may not
              be evident because of a historical shift in the level of
              abstraction, which determines how the world is implemented in the
              game mechanics. Adventure games have increasingly curbed the
              agency of the player in the world, in order to facilitate
              completing the story of the game. This move to a less
              fine-grained interaction has affected different aspects of game
              design, from reducing the number of possible actions to limiting
              the interactivity of non-player characters. The dissertation
              discusses how adventure games have integrated story with the
              performance in the simulated world of the game. This integration
              is further evidenced by how they apply to the four basic elements
              that bridge story and game design: space, player character,
              non-player character and time. The qualities of these elements
              help us understand how the player performs in the simulation, and
              how that performance is designed. Analyzing the properties of the
              simulation in adventure games helps draw comparisons with other
              videogame genres. The rich history of adventure games can inform
              the game design of other videogames, particularly in relation to
              the creation of fictional worlds, strategies to script the
              interactor, and design of non-player characters.",

               player’s engagement with the game system has become more
               appealing to a broader range of researchers beyond the computer
               sciences. Within game studies, the appropriation and use of
               gameplay metrics not only further shifts these methods beyond
               formalized user testing (e.g. with the aim of product
               improvement) but creates a demand for a more universal approach
               to game metric extraction that can be applied to a wider range
               of games and account for different social science research
               agendas. Set in the context of a study into player experiences
               with participants aged 14-16 years of age, a method of
               articulating and identifying key moments of game-play pertinent
               to an analysis of experience with simulated violence was
               required [38]. This paper describes a pragmatic solution to the
               need to study a range of games that were determined not by the
               researchers but the study’s participants. The solution exploits
               and examines the audio-video feedbacks presented to the player
               as part of their engagement with a game system. This paper
               broadly outlines this mode of metric extraction and its
               application to research that seeks to understand the nature of
               engagement and player motivations across a mixed methodology

               patterns that reduce the possibility of failure (as seen in the
