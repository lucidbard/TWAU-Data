- Using the story intention graph to model narrative elements of a
  commercially released choice-based interactive narrative
** Thesis
Applying existing computational models of narrative discourse enables
us to balance the necessarily subjective interpretation of story with
more objective measures of its meaning and the dynamic of critical
semantic relationships within interactive fiction. This paper
describes the application of David Elson's Story Intention Graph to a
commercially and critically successful interactive narrative, The Wolf
Among Us. The application revealed several interesting research
directions and requirements to leveraging the model, as well as
insights into how interactivity and choice functions in the narrative
in this particular work.

The Wolf Among Us presents a powerful example of an interactive
narrative which has what Aarseth calls dynamic kernels. It integrates
player choices on multiple dimensions into a tale with resonance and a
strong player community. (Evidence as a significant work). It has an
adaptation in comic book form.

** Critical Analysis of Interactive Narratives 
Why do we want to use computational models for interactive narratives?
There are three strands of work in computational narratology: first,
the generation of narratives, second the assistance in the authoring
of narratives, and third, the automated understanding of narrative
content.
** Methodology
 - Translated a "natural" selected traversal from the first episode to
   Ink format, including descriptions of expressions, settings and
   relevant objects.
 - Considered ChoiceScript & Twine as both capable of representing the
   types of narratives Telltale produces.
   - Representing simple variables (whether a certain choice had been
     visited/selected and conditionals based on that)
   - Provide simple metadata such as whether a line is dialogue or
     description, and which character was involved.
   - Simplified notation of converging threads and player choices
 - Easy-to-read text format for using existing SIG modeling tool,
   Scheherazade.
 - Classified response options
 - Divided content into beats
   - Representable by changing sub-goals of a character in a scene
     that are in fulfillment of longer term goals.
   - An example is the Toad imploring Bigby to be lenient, which is in
     service of the goal (shared with others) of remaining in
     Fabletown and not being deported to The Farm.
 - Decided against modeling propositional level of content at a fine
   grain, instead focusing on the larger goals and values, beliefs and
   affect.
   - Based on the results of David Elson's findings on analogy +
     Beowulf.

** Results
- Character's voice, attitude, and emotions are difficult to model
  consistently using propositional logic. Interpretation is necessary,
  and the ambiguity is difficult to represent.
- The authorial goals are not highlighted; delivering exposition,
  revealing facts to the player.
- Story Intention Graphs map out a particular interpretation. The Wolf
  Among Us has at least two fundamentally different interpretations of
  the causal event, which cannot be represented using the format. This
  ambiguity is not uncommon, with other resonating ambiguity in
  critically acclaimed literature and film alike. (EXAMPLES).
- A given section of content may be identical, but its interpretation
  is colored by previous events in the mind of the player but not in
  the game.
- The game tracks certain events and decisions for use in future
  choices.
- Number of Choices of each type:
- 
- Types of Choices
  - Significant (Referred to later, degree by how many content
    referred to)
  - Binary (Branching)
  - Relationship
  - Telltale Key (Chosen by Telltale at the end to show stats)
  - Satellite (content that is optional)
- Identity Choices
  - Asshole
  - Kind
  - Concern
  - Query
  - Stating Belief (Player)
  - Stating Belief (Bigby)

1. Show causal relationships between choices and all antecedents
2. Show how player agency fits into the narrative flow
3. Show the main value changes and events
4. Indicate frequency and distribution of player decisions
5. Show the semantic spread of player choices
   - E.g. how different are the choices from one another?
   - What value is being represented by each choice?
   - What player desire or preference (information, belief, curiosity)
     is being indicated through selections?

Questions answerable through a visualization:
1. What is the totality of constant versus variable content for a
   particular game?
3. What role does each content segment play in orienting the player to
   the key information, including characters, concepts, conflicts and
   especially the unchanging identity of the protagonist?
4. What role does extra-diegetic indicators (E.g. Toad will remember
   that) play in trigger player reactions and perhaps even the eliza
   effect?
** Decide on a traversal record format. Possibly PlayTrace?
- Record each choice and its prerequisite (true/false of a variable).
- Determine which variables are associated with which choice points.
  - Document the key variables and their "Payoffs"
- Record the following dialogue after each choice point.
- Record each "Recorded Traversal" in a format to make sure that the
  dialogue/content is associated with the correct decisions.
** TODO Research the closest relevant corpuses
Examples of alternate modalities represented in this survey include
video (Mbengue 2013), image (Lee et al. 2012), speech (Tomai et
al. 2011), and game logs (Orkin et al. 2010), but many other
modalities are possible.  5.5
** TODO Record the rest of choice options and traversal texts of The Wolf Among Us Episode 1.
** Representing traversals & structure
*** Some choice-points are skipped or optional, some are unordered
- Clockwise might be one way to select unordered items, but in the
  case of the investigation of Lawrence's room, certain options only
  show up after certain items have been visited.
- Some "satellite" choices may not be required to visit.
- Combat sequences generally have few words.

** Notes
- Working with Ink presented some practical issues with this large of
  a project. The time for the program to parse the input increased
  with the number of choices, and there didn't appear to be any
  optimizations as any line of code could affect any previous content
  element.
- For certain timed decisions, like offering Colin a Drink or giving
  the money, there is a default if the timer expires.
- The first scene has few significant choices. Here they are:
  - Whether to let Toad off or not. This is linked to the choice for
    how to play out "I'll tell you what I told Toad". Which is
    nothing, he's a smart guy.
  - Whether to give Faith money or not.
  - Whether to let Faith keep on with the axe.
  - What values are at stake? How do you classify value stakes in
    choices? (Morality, Ego, Power, Justice)
- "Affinity Games" as in Facade, the player is forced to choose
  between Beauty and Beast. 
- Natural First Traversal -- a player that plays the game from
  beginning to end without an opportunity to have seen previous choice
  results and thus knowing anything about the game.
- Compare usefulness of a "first traversal" with Nick Montfort, Aaron
  Reed "complete traversal" for this type of experience.
- Single-game Corpus. A set of natural traversals
- How long does the player take to read the options? How long does the decision take?
- What emotional cues are present in the player after key information is delivered?
- What makes for significant, moving decisions? What aspects of
  narrative predict these moments and the possible results? What
  elements affect the intensity of a given response?
- Removing the emphasis on replayabliity present in Facade.

** Social Emotions
- "Para-social interaction" from Katherine Isbister How Games Move Us:
  EMotion by Design (Playful Thinking). Donald Horton and Richard
  R. Wohl "Mass Communication and Para-Social Interaction:
  Observations on Intimacy at a Distance"
- "So if we see or hear (or form a mental picture of) a person
  experiencing feelings in a social setting that we, too, are immersed
  in, our brains are "tricked" into believing that a real social
  experience is taking place. loc 406. "Grounded" in experience
- "This capacity to evoke actual feelings of guilt from a fictional
  experience is unique to games. A reader or filmgoer may feel many
  emotions when presented with horrific fictional acts on the page or
  screen, but responsibility and guilt are generally not among
  them. At most, they may feel a sense of uneasy
  collusion. Conversely, a film viewer might feel joyful when the
  protagonist wins, but is not likely to feel a sense of personal
  responsibility and pride. Betcause they depend on active player
  choice, games hav an additional palette of social emotions at their
  disposal.
