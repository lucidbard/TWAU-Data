*** Last Year Reviews
The paper proposes a formal coding of the "surface content" for
interactive narratives. While any effort towards a shared
formalization of interactive narrative is laudable, we found that the
paper lacked clarity and had a too restricted theoretical background.

First, the concept of "operational logic", as it is used in the paper
is fuzzy. It is not to say that this theory is invalid, but normally,
a theoretical framework should help reading. We feel that it is not
the case here.

Second, the paper moves from "operational logic" to "story logic",
without properly explaining what the latter means.

Third, 5 examples of story control logic are provided. It is unclear
if they are all 5 into one game design, or if an author would choose
among them. Regarding the first one, it seems under-developed, because
it does not include the fact that the choices may be presented in
different ways (either the explicit sentence that will be uttered, or
a global intention, for example). The description of the Inventory
Logics is unclear: what is the link between objects in inventories and
tracking certain content choices?

Fourth, the use of timecodes is confusing. It is said that "the
gameplay footage cannot be simply mapped to traditional timecodes."
but the timecodes are still used in the shots and segments. What does
it refer to? To the timecodes of a specific traversal? Maybe it should
just be mentioned explicitly.

Fifth, preconditions are mentioned, but not used in the schemas. In
addition, if precondition are included, are we still talking about
"surface content"? At the end, what is "surface content"?

Sixth, the authors roughly refer to Mateas and Wardrip-fruin work, but
as far as choice-based adventure games are concerned, we are dealing
with hypermedia. A lot of research has been done in this field,
including in terms of coding (e.g. Amsterdam Hypermedia Model). I
would encourage authors to step back and look in other but similar
research areas, in other continents also.

Seventh, SIGs are mentioned a few times (for example "There are other
operational logics at work, such as collision logics and camera
control logics, but these don't affect the story structure as defined
by the SIG."), as if they were a full part of the theoretical
framework, but they are not introduced in that way.

Eights, from a methodological point of view, a first research question
is raised, then, in the evaluation part, a revised one is proposed and
finally, some examples of questions are proposed. It looks like the
authors are "improvising" their methodology. The research goal and
questions should be presented beforehand, and the evaluation should
derive naturally from them (maybe easier to write than do).

To summarize, there is an interesting intention behind this research,
but the research goals should be clarified, and the scope of
references enlarged.

*** 
This paper proposes a representation for the "surface story content"
in a cinematic choice-based adventure game. It additionally shows a
tool for browsing these representations, and proposes an evaluation
strategy.

While it seems the top-level goal of the paper is reasonable, it is
 extremely unclear to me what the paper contributes. The author
 presents a set of json-like data structures for encoding the "surface
 structure" of the game.  It is unclear to me what this approach
 brings to the table beyond existing approaches for representing the
 unfolding of interactive narrative games: indeed, there is no review
 of the prior literature in this area. But surface structure is never
 clearly defined, and the correspondence between the five necessary
 operational logics and the json structures is not outlined.  The tool
 is not explained in any detail or depth, so it is unclear what its
 capabilities are; it is even unclear if the tool was created by the
 author. The amount of work required to actually annotate a game using
 this tool is not explained, and it is also not explained how the
 author would ensure that all possible choices and paths would be
 followed: some games will have choices that p!  resent randomly or
 only under certain circumstances. The proposed evaluation seems to be
 just a list of questions, with no clear outline of what answers would
 indicate a successful evaluation.

Minor:
-abstract: capture --> captures
-first sentence: Telltale Games --> Telltale Games'
-shouldn't the sections be numbered? Section numbering appears to begin on page 8
-first sentence of second section: Telltale Game's --> Telltale Games'
-last sentence, first para, 2nd section: "...the original media that of..." --> strike "that"?
-Operational logic table: erroneous forward slashes?
-the references are a disaster; the urls need to be removed
*** 
This paper describes the initial stages of a project whose goal is to
document the surface structure of multiple "traversals" of an
interactive game (the wolf among us).  This game is chose because it
is representative of the larger class of cinematic, branching
narrative games.

WHile the topic is certainly original and interesting, I have found
the writing and the structure of the paper very confusing. The problem
statement is summarized in a single sentence which is unfortunately
not really comprehensible.  Indeed, it uses terms which are later
defined.

The paper makes frequent references to David Elson's story intention
graphs (SIG) but they are not motivated at all.

Sections and paragraphs are not numbered until the last two pages.

Code examples are not explained or commented (what language is bing
used ?).

The research question is revised at the end, which further increased
my confusion.

As a result, I was not able to make any sense of this submission and I
suggest that it needs to be rewritten entirely.

TOPIC AREAS

ICIDS welcomes contributions from a large range of fields and
disciplines related to interactive storytelling. We encourage original
contributions in the forms of research papers, position papers,
posters and demonstrations, presenting new scientific results,
innovative theories, novel technological implementations, case studies
and creative artistic projects in the field of Interactive Digital
Storytelling and its possible applications in different domains. We
particularly welcome research on topics in the following five areas:
**** BRAVE NEW IDEAS
We invite papers that explore highly innovative ideas and/or paradigm
shifts in conventional theory and practice of interactive
storytelling. 

We seek to draw attention to methods that differ from the state of the
art in practice or theory and demonstrate potential for changed ways
of thinking. These papers may not be “complete” in the “traditional”
manner in the sense that it may not be possible to have experimental
results comparing other related efforts or that they may not have
large, publicly available data sets to be used for performance
comparison.

The aim is to establish a roadmap for the next 5 years as a community
guideline for the development of the field.

**** Abstract
Information professionals face the challenge of making sense of an
ever increasing amount of information. Storylines can provide a useful
way to present relevant information because they reveal explanatory
relations between events. In this position paper, we present and
discuss the four main challenges that make it difficult to get to
these stories and our first ideas on how to start resolving them.
*** Representing Dramatic Features of Stories through an Ontological Model
Mario Cataldi, Rossana Damiano, Vincenzo Lombardo, and Antonio Pizzo
**** Abstract 
In this paper we present a novel ontology-based model for the
representation of the dramatic features of narrative media (video,
text, audio, etc.), focused on the notions of the character’s
motivated actions.  We describe the theoretical background, composed
of narratological theories and rational agent theories, that support
the proposed ontological formalization. We sketch the ontology and an
encoding example.

Mario Cataldi1, Rossana Damiano1, Vincenzo Lombardo1, Antonio Pizzo, and Dario Sergi
**** Abstract
In this paper we present an innovative approach for semantic
annotation of narrative media objects (video, text, audio, etc.) that
integrates vast commonsense ontological knowledge to a novel
ontologybased model of narrative, Drammar (focused on the dramatic
concepts of ‘character’ and ‘action’), to permit the annotation of
their narrative features.

We also describe the annotation workflow and propose a general
architecture that guides the annotation process and permits
annotation-based reasoning and search operations. We finally
illustrate the proposed annotation model through real examples.

*** NOVEL APPROACH TO DETERMINING TEMPO AND DRAMATIC STORY SECTIONS IN MOTION PICTURES
Brett Adamst, Chitra Dora$, Svetha Venkatesht 
**** Abstract
This paper presents an original computational approach to extraction
of movie tempo for deriving story sections and events that convey high
level semantics of stories portrayed in motion pictures, thus enabling
better video annotation and interpretation systems. This approach,
inspired by the existing cinematic conventions known as film grammar,
uses the attributes of motion and shot length to define and compute a
novel continuous measure of tempo of a movie. Tempo flow plots are
derived for several full-length motion pictures and edge detection is
performed to extract dramatic story sections and events occumng in the
movie, underlined by their unique tempo. The results confirm reliable
detection of actual distinct tempo changes and serve as useful index
into the dramatic development and narration of the story in motion
pictures.
*** Semantic annotation of narrative media objects.
Vincenzo Lombardo · Rossana Damiano
**** Abstract
This paper addresses the annotation of the narrative features of media objects.
Based on a relevant narratological and computational background, we introduce
an ontology–based model called Drammar, an annotation schema for the narrative
features of media objects based on Drammar and a software tool, Cinematic, for annotating
these objects and validating the annotation. Annotated media objects can also
be automatically edited into sequences, with the twofold goal of testing the validity of
the annotation – through the reconstruction of the baseline sequence – and exploring
the possibility of alternative sequences.
The software tool encodes both the narrative model and the annotation itself in
ontological format, and relies on external ontologies for representing world knowledge
and limit the arbitrariness of the annotation.
The paper opens the way to the design of a general annotation schema for narrative
multimedia with the long–term goal of building large corpora of annotated video material
and of bridging the gap between the low–level signal analysis and the high–level
semantic representation of the narrative content of the media objects.
Finally, the paper illustrates a few projects elaborated with the Drammar annotation
and the Cinematic tool, with purposes of artistic research and cross–media
analysis, that provide an empirical validation of the annotation process.
*** An intelligent tool for narrative-based video annotation and editing
Vincenzo Lombardo
Rossana Damiano
**** Abstract
Recently, there has been much development in the annotation and
automatic editing of video segments. The major issue has been the
re-use of segments through a number of different editing
processes. However, the annotation of the story progression through
video segments has not received much attention. This paper presents an
intelligent tool for narrativebased annotation and editing of video
segments.  The annotation schema relies on a formal theory for the
annotation of story structure in video segments and on a juxtaposition
engine for the automatic editing. The method has been implemented in a
software programme that has been employed, in the re-use perspective,
for artistic applications and, in the analysis perspective, for
cross-medial comparison of stories.

This paper outlines a roadmap for interactive narrative research that
integrates disparate parts while focusing on identifying and
experimentally verifying IDN design conventions and on developing a
pedagogy to further the development of a professional discipline of
IDN creators. This effort connects several key areas, in which the
authors have worked before and which are now brought together. These
include a specific theory, an approach towards interactive narrative
design and its evaluation, an expanded understanding of the
manifestations constituting the field, the pedagogy of educating
creators of IDN artifacts and a perspective on the cultural
significance of these creative expressions as tools to represent
complexity.

**** Illustrative Topics and Questions
- What cognitive competencies underlie narrative, and how may they be studied?
- Can narrative be subsumed by current models of higher-level cognition, or does it require new approaches?
- How do narratives mediate our cognitive experiences, or affect our cognitive abilities?
- How are narratives indexed and retrieved? Is there a universal scheme for encoding episodic information?
- What comprises the set of possible narrative arcs? Is there such a set? How many possible story lines are there?
- Is narrative structure universal, or are there systematic differences in narratives from different cultures?
- What makes narrative different from a list of events or facts? What is special that makes something a narrative?
- What are the details of the relationship between narrative and common sense?
- What shared resources are required for the computational study of narrative?
- What should a “Story Bank” contain?
- What shared resources are available, or how can already-extant resources be adapted to the study of narrative?
- What impact do the purpose, function, and genre of a narrative have on its form and content?
- What are appropriate formal or computational representations for narrative?
- How should we evaluate computational and formal models of narrative?

***** Extending and Evaluating a Platform for Story Understanding
We present Scheherazade, a foundational platform for narrative
intelligence that formally represents stories. The system draws upon
prior theoretical work on the morphology of narrative without imposing
a particular narrative domain or task a priori. Instead, while keeping
narrative semantics separate and immutable, it provides a framework
for the tools that build upon it to define world knowledge on a
per-task basis. The system models semantics such as timelines, states,
events, characters and goals, and can detect thematic patterns in both
the deep content of the story (i.e., the fabula) and the manner of the
story's telling (the sujzhet). We also present a sample tool that
utilizes the platform to assist users who are unfamiliar with
narratology to symbolically encode stories into this representation. A
formative evaluation of this tool shows that technical and
non-technical users can successfully encode a traditional fable using
its graphical interface.

Narrative is a pervasive aspect of human culture in both entertainment and education. Historically,
humans have been the primary agents behind the creation, telling, and adapting of narrative.
However, as society’s reliance on digital technology for both entertainment and communication
increases, the need for more innovative approaches to represent, perform, and adapt narrative experiences
increases as well. With recent research advances, computer systems now have the means
to organize experiences into a narrative form enabling them to interact and communicate with human
users in novel and intuitive ways that were not possible a short time ago. A computer system
that possesses narrative intelligence can interact with and communicate with human users in novel

The academic research community is continuing to make advances in intelligent computing that
bring these experiences closer to realizing the full potential of the computer as an interactive
medium. The Intelligent Narrative Technologies III (INT3) workshop at the 2010 Foundations
of Digital Games (FDG) conference brings together participants from the research community and
industry in an effort to accelerate technology transfer to commercial games. Computer games are a
natural modality for storytelling because of the sense of immersion and transportation into a virtual
world with compelling characters and the promise of opportunity to interact with characters and
the world in a meaningful way. Many experiences in virtual worlds are entertaining but not necessarily
strictly games. A second goal of the INT3 workshop was to explore the role of narrative
intelligence in facilitating other forms of computer-based entertainment, education, and training.
Narrative appears prominently in many forms of entertainment and interpersonal communication,
including novels, movies, and machinima. Narrative can also play a role in education and training.
Novel techniques for entertaining, training, and eduction have been developed in such fields
as narrative understanding, narrative generation, storytelling, virtual cinematography, models of
emotion, narrative cognition, and natural language generation.
The 2010 INT3 workshop is the third in a successful sequence of symposia and workshops on
artificial intelligence in representation and reasoning about narrative. The one-day INT3 workshop
features 17 paper presentations from authors around the world on topics ranging from narrative
understanding, emergent storytelling, player evaluations, narrative discourse, improvisation, and
story generation.

***** Towards a Computational Model of Narrative Visualization 
Alok Baikadi, Julius Goth, Christopher M. Mitchell, Eun Y. Ha, Bradford W. Mott, James C. Lester
****** Abstract
The task of narrative visualization has been the subject of increasing
interest in recent years. Much like data visualization, narrative
visualization offers users an informative and aesthetically pleasing
perspective on “storydata.” Automatically creating visual
representations ofnarratives poses significant computational
challenges due to the complex affective and causal elements, among
other things, that must be realized in visualizations. In addition,
narratives that are composed by novice writers pose additional
challenges due to the disfluencies stemming from ungrammatical
text. In this paper, we introduce the NARRATIVE THEATRE, a narrative
visualization system under development in our laboratory that
generates narrative visualizations from middle school writers’
text. The NARRATIVE THEATRE consists of a rich writing interface, a
robust natural language processor, a narrative reasoner, and a
storyboard generator. We discuss design issues bearing on narrative
visualization, introduce the NARRATIVE THEATRE, and describe narrative
corpora that have been collected to study narrative visualization. We
conclude with a discussion of a narrative visualization research
agenda.

***** A conversational framework for emergent collaborative storytelling
Damian Hills

This paper proposes a framework that incorporates shared narration
through the design and evaluation of a creativity support system that
promotes meaning and sense-making for collaborative storytelling in a
situated context. The approach is to develop a holistic system that
enables the processes during a group conversation, or the situated
modalities associated with oral storytelling.
***** Predicting reader response in narrative

Inderjeet Mani
****** Abstract
This paper sketches a theory of how readers (or users, or players, or
viewers) respond to narratives. Such a theory can be useful for
developing evaluation functions to allow for narrative outcomes that
have maximum impact at particular times on the reader. The reader's
response is viewed in terms of character evaluations, namely judgments
of sympathy or antipathy for the agent involved in that
outcome. Character development is computed in terms of transitions in
reader evaluations for an agent over the time course of the
narrative. To formally model character evaluations, we begin with a
representation of the narrative fabula in terms of the events, their
participant roles, and their temporal relations. This representation
is implemented on a corpus of narratives with existing tools and
standards. Reader evaluations are annotated on events in the
fabula. Once high reliability in human character evaluations has been
proven, a character evaluation tagger will be trained on these
evaluations.
***** Semi-automatic task recognition for interactive narratives with EAT & RUN
Jeff Orkin, Tynan Smith, Hilke Reckman, Deb Roy
****** Abstract
Mining data from online games provides a potential alternative to
programming behavior and dialogue for characters in interactive
narratives by hand. Human annotation of course-grained tasks can
provide explanations that make the data more useful to an AI system,
however human labor is expensive. We describe a semi-automatic
methodology for recognizing tasks in gameplay traces, including an
annotation tool for non-experts, and a runtime algorithm. Our results
show that this methodology works well with a large corpus from one
game, and suggests the possibility of refactoring the development
process for interactive narratives.

In this paper, we describe a novel approach to teaching early mathematical concepts to young children. This approach aims to merge storytelling and Maths. Evidence show that through dramatic games and role-playing activities young children (aging from 5--7 years old) learn to master new knowledge, to fit in a new school setting and to socially relate with their peers. So taking this evidence into account, it is possible to devise an innovative collaborative learning scenario that teaches early mathematical concepts by telling and creating stories. More than doing it in the traditional formats (oral or theatrical form), we are investigating the possibility to take this scenario to an innovative computerised platform -- Microsoft Surface™.

User evaluation of virtual reporting agents

doi>10.1145/1822309.1822314
Full text: PDFPDF

Many persistent online environments such as Massively-Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), feature weblogs and/or live reportage of participants' activities in the world. While such reports and commentary can enhance the user's enjoyment and increase their sense of shared experience, the demands of such large scale reporting on the participants can be considerable. To address this problem a number of in-game reporting and commentary systems have been proposed which use virtual "reporter" agents within the game to produce real-time and post-game commentary tailored to the interests of individual users. However, to date, there has been no evaluation of these systems from a user perspective. In this paper we present the results of a live evaluation study performed using an instance of the online role-playing game Neverwinter Nights augmented with witness-narrator agents to provide in-game and post-game reports. Our results indicate that reporting does increase enjoyment of the game, and that players play for longer when their activities are recorded on a community web page, suggesting that agent-based reporting is a promising approach to community building in online games and social environments.

Creating content for different forms of interactive narratives requires a different set of skills and techniques than writing non-interactive stories. In this paper we describe a prototype tangible interactive narrative system called the Reading Glove and outline the authoring process used to create story content for it. We begin by discussing different approaches to authoring that are currently in use in interactive digital storytelling. We then discuss in detail the process of writing the story for the Reading Glove and provide an analysis of the fiction created through this process. We put forth the notion of "cognitive hyperlinks": a design technique that we believe has utility for the authors of future interactive narratives. We conclude with a set of general design recommendations for authoring within interactive storytelling systems.

A method for generating narrative discourse to prompt inferences
James Niehaus, R. Michael Young
Article No.: 7
doi>10.1145/1822309.1822316
Full text: PDFPDF

Narratives that prompt inferences can be more interesting in that they provide the reader with the opportunity to reason about the narrative world, participating in its construction. These narratives can also be more concise and direct, as details can be filled in by the reader. On the other hand, narratives that leave out important information without the opportunity to infer this information may be incoherent. To generate narratives that prompt inferences a system must 1) employ a theory of how inferences are prompted and 2) provide a capacity for creating narratives that satisfy inference goals. This paper presents is a novel algorithm for generating discourse plans that prompt inferences according to a theory of online inferencing in narrative discourse. Though other approaches have generated narrative and discourse structures to influence the reader's perception of the narrative, this is the first approach to present an empirically based cognitive model of online inference generation. The algorithm is a partial-order planning approach to discourse generation, selecting events to tell the reader from an input story plan.

This paper describes our current approach in implementing computational improvisational micro-agents, agents that perform one specific aspect of our findings from the Digital Improv Project. This approach is intended to foster bottom-up research to better understand how to build more complex agent behaviors in a theatrical improvisational setting. The Digital Improv Project is a multi-year study at the Georgia Institute of Technology focused on studying real life theatrical improvisers with an aim towards better understanding the cognition employed in improvisation at the individual and group level.

Using narrative functions as a heuristic for relevance in story understanding
Emmett Tomai, Ken Forbus
Article No.: 9
doi>10.1145/1822309.1822318
Full text: PDFPDF

Story understanding requires a degree of knowledge and expressiveness beyond the current state of natural language understanding. We present an approach that addresses these needs, using a large-scale knowledge base, simplified English grammar and a combination of compositional frame semantics and abductive reasoning. This in turn raises a significant challenge disambiguating complex semantic structures, which requires a pragmatics of narrative for constraint and guidance. We present a theory of narrative functions that serve as a heuristic for relevance in narrative, and provide evidence that this heuristic is effective for disambiguation that leads to consistent understanding.

Social games---common patterns of character interactions that modify the social environment of the story world---provide a useful abstraction when authoring a story composed of interactive characters, making it possible to create games with deep possibility spaces that are about social interaction (which would be intractable if hand-authoring all the options). In this paper, we detail the workings of a major new version of our social artificial intelligence system, Comme il Faut, that enables social game play in interactive media experiences. The workings of Comme il Faut 2 are shown, with running examples, from both knowledge representation and process perspectives. Finally, the paper concludes with a plan for evaluating and demonstrating Comme il Faut 2 through an implementation of an interactive media experience that consists of a playable social space.

Full text: PDFPDF

Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) are known for their strong narrative structure. Over time, quests have become one of the main mechanics for leading a player through the story. Quests are given to the player in the form of a set of tasks to complete with few, if any, options. The options given to the player instead often revolve around combat-oriented actions -- requiring the player to engage in combat to progress through the storyline, despite player preference or game story that hints otherwise. We address this issue with the GrailGM, a run-time game master which offers quests and actions to the player based on their history and current world state.

Interactive narrative planning offers significant potential for creating engaging narrative experiences that are tailored to individual users. Orchestrating all of the events in a storyworld to create optimal user experiences calls for effective narrative decision-making. A key requirement of this endeavor is understanding the role that different knowledge sources play in narrative decision making. To investigate knowledge sources for interactive narrative, a corpus was collected in a Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) study conducted with a narrative-centered learning environment. With narrative planning and natural language dialogue functionalities provided by wizards, the data from the WOZ study offers insight into the knowledge sources involved in narrative decision making and suggests how these knowledge sources can be effectively utilized by a narrative planner to create engaging interactive narratives.

Full text: PDFPDF

A key functionality provided by interactive narrative systems is narrative adaptation: augmenting story experiences in response to users' actions, and tailoring story elements to individual users' preferences and needs. However, the task of interactive narrative adaptation is not yet well defined. There is little consensus about the key features of a general model for narrative adaptation, which results in a limited ability to draw comparisons between alternate solutions. This paper aims to synthesize a diverse range of approaches to narrative adaptation, as well as related experience management techniques from intelligent tutoring systems, in order to devise a framework for more clearly conceptualizing the general task of interactive narrative adaptation. The framework has three components: plot adaptation, discourse adaptation, and user tailoring. The conceptual framework is illustrated with examples from Crystal Island, an interactive narrative-centered learning environment for middle school microbiology. The framework is being used to inform preliminary development efforts on an interactive narrative director agent for the Crystal Island learning environment, and aims to provide a first step toward establishing a general model of interactive narrative.

Shared mental models in improvisational performance

Full text: PDFPDF

This paper describes the mental structures called shared mental models, which are heavily related to group problem solving and cognition, and reports how they are related to theatrical improvisation based on our empirical findings. We have conducted a series of studies on real life improvisers aimed at uncovering the underlying cognition involved in improvisation, with the end goal of having a clear understanding of how to build improvisational synthetic characters. We describe cognitive divergence, when improvisers have conflicting mental models of what is occurring on stage, and cognitive convergence, which is the process of resolving such conflicts within the performance. These findings are supported by examples from our study and are used to make conclusions about improvisational synthetic character design.

Full text: PDFPDF

Interactive narrative is an approach to interactive entertainment or learning in which a system attempts to tell a story to an interactive participant. In this paper we report on a study to compare the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of two approaches to developing computational interactive narrative systems. We compare two approaches to interactive narrative: emergent approaches utilizing autonomous virtual character agents, and drama management approaches utilizing semi-autonomous virtual character agents. Our study uses improvisational theatre as an idealized, human analogue to computational interactive narrative. Results suggest that, regardless of approach, idealized interactive narrative systems should be nearly indistinguishable in terms of character believability and narrative coherence. Results suggest that drama management systems may have an advantage when particular features are required to emerge in players' interactive experiences.

Full text: PDFPDF

RoleModel is a novel story generator organized around explicit formal models of character roles. RoleModel expands the expressiveness of stories generated from arbitrary partial domain specification by using a formal model of roles within an abductive logic programming framework. Authorial goals in the system can be fully or partially specified as constraints in an abductive logic program. In particular, the RoleModel system focuses on representing and satisfying role constraints of the story characters. This paper discusses the basic architecture for the RoleModel approach, demonstrates example output from the system through three use-cases, discusses the authorial expressiveness enabled by a "stageless" abductive logic approach to story generation, and proposes the current and future directions.

***** Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are widely used in video
games. Recently, AI planning methods have been applied to maintain
plot consistency in the face of player’s agency over the
narrative. Combined with an automatically populated player model, such
AI experience managers can dynamically create a consistent narrative
tailored to a specific player.  These tools help game narrative
designers achieve narrative goals while affording players a choice. On
the other hand, they increase the number of feasible plot branches
making it more difficult for the author to ensure that each branch
carries the player along a desired emotion arc. In this paperwe
discuss the problem and call for an extension of experience managers
with player emotion models. When successful, interactive narrative can
be then automatically produced to satisfy authorial goals not only in
terms of specific events but also in terms of emotions evoked in the
player.

**** [[chrome-extension://bomfdkbfpdhijjbeoicnfhjbdhncfhig/view.html?mp=qNrr65EM][Emotion-based interactive storytelling with Artificial Intelligence]]
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely used in video
games to control non-playable characters. More recently, AI has been
applied to automated story generation and game-mastering: managing the
player's experience in an interactive narrative on-the-fly. Such
methods allow the narrative to be generated dynamically, in response
to the player's in-game actions. As a result, it is more difficult for
the human game designers to ensure that each possible narrative
trajectory will elicit desired emotional response from the player. We
tackle this problem by computationally predicting the player's
emotional response to a narrative segment. We use the predictions
within an AI experience manager to shape the narrative dynamically
during the game to keep the player on an author-supplied target
emotional curve.

** Abstract
Analyzing interactive digital storytelling experiences has proven a
challenging interdisciplinary endeavor in part due to the variety of
approaches and to the as-yet-unsolved challenge of fully modeling
narrative meaning. The competing values and goals of the community
which share the same interest has resulted in a tapestry of efforts
that often do not build upon one another, but instead seek to amend
perceived faults in the execution or in the coverage of previous
approaches. This paper surveys efforts at understanding interactive
narrative through three lenses: player emotions or affect, player
interaction or choices, and player knowledge or beliefs. These lenses
provide insight into how the communities goals relate to existing
efforts. We use these observations to develop a theory of modeling
interactive narrative content with the goal of separating the
necessary efforts into layers that can build upon one another. The
core contention of the proposed layered approach is that a unified
theory of interactive digital narratives is counterproductive in
understanding how specific artifacts operate and in guiding the
creation of novel artifacts which achieve similar effects.
