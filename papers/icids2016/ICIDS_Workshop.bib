abstract = {This paper describes, implements and assesses a series of user-log indicators for automatic interactive narrative evaluation. The indicators include length and duration, diversity, renewal, choice range, choice frequency, and choice variety. Based on a laboratory experiment with players, a significant positive correlation has been observed between two indicators and some aspects of the interactive narrative experience measured by validated scales based on questionnaires.

abstract = {Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) and the formal authorial process for this medium. We explore the current state-of-the-Art in IDN authorial approaches and consider the perspective of a traditional and technologically na{\"{i}}ve author. We propose a combination of meta-narrative and autonomous agent approaches in a quest to democratize IDN authoring to a wider, less technically oriented audience. In doing so, we ask fundamental questions with regards to how the user experience can be expressed within the authorial process. We also, as part of this discussion, reflect on the nature of authoring IDNs and the author him/herself.},

abstract = {While authoring has long been a concern for researchers engaged in interactive narrative, generalized design approaches have been less of a focus. At the same time, the need for design conventions to aid in the creation of artifacts has long been recognized, starting with Murray's 1997 Hamlet on the Holodeck. However, unlike in the related field of game design, widely accepted, generalized conventions are still elusive. In this paper I investigate the state of affairs and identify several broad trajectories in the scholarly treatment of interactive narrative authoring. I propose a process and a set of design heuristics developed in my practice of teaching interactive digital narrative.},
