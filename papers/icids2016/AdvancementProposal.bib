In this paper I examine the potential of three kinds of plot for active user participation: the epic plot, which focuses on the struggle of the individual to survive in a hostile world, the dramatic plot, which deals with the evolution of a network of human relations, and the epistemic plot, which is propelled by the desire to solve a mystery. I distinguish two basic types of immersion—ludic and narrative, the latter subdivided into spatial, temporal and emotional variants, and I discuss the ability of the three kinds of plot to generate these various forms of immersion.},

abstract = {Narrative is one of the fundamental cognitive tools that we use to understand the world around us. When interacting with other humans we rely on a shared knowledge of narrative structure, but in order to enable this kind of communication with digital artifacts we must first formalize these narrative conventions. Narratology, computer science, and cognitive science have formed a symbiotic relationship around this endeavor to create computational models of narrative. These models provide us a deeper understanding of story structure and will enable us to create a fundamentally new kind of interactive narrative experience in which the author, the audience, and the machine all participate in the story composition process. This document presents a computational model of narrative conflict, its empirical evaluation, and its deployment in an interactive narrative experience. Narratologists have described conflict in terms of the difficulties that an intelligent agent encounters while executing a plan to achieve a goal [33, 34]. This definition is inherently plan-based, and has been integrated into an existing model of narrative based on the data structures and algorithms of artificial intelligence planning—the process of constructing a sequence of actions to achieve a goal. The Conflict Partial Order Causal Link (or CPOCL) model of narrative represents the events of a story along with their causal structure and temporal constraints. It extends previous models by representing non-executed actions which describe how an agent intended to complete its plans even if those plans failed, thus enabling an explicit representation of thwarted plans and con- flict. The model also includes seven dimensions which can distinguish one conflict from another and provide authors with greater control over story generation: participants, topic, duration, balance, directness, intensity, and resolution. One valuable aspect of plan-based models is that they can be generated and modified automatically. Two story creation methods are discussed: the plan-space CPOCL algorithm that works directly with the rich CPOCL knowledge representation and the state-space Glaive algorithm which is significantly faster. Glaive achieves its speedup by incorporating research from fast forward-chaining state-space heuristic search planning and by using the constraints that a valid narrative plan must obey to calculate a more accurate heuristic. Glaive is fast enough to solve certain non-trivial narrative planning problems in real time. This computational model of narrative conflict has been evaluated in a series of empirical experiments. The first validates the three discrete dimensions of conflict: participants, topic, and duration. It demonstrates that a human audience recognizes thwarted plans in static text stories in the same places that the CPOCL model defines them to exist. The second experiment validates the four continuous dimensions—balance, directness, intensity, and resolution—by showing that a human audience ranks static text stories in the same order defined by the formulas for those dimensions. The final experiment is an evaluation of an interactive narrative video game called The Best Laid Plans, which uses Glaive to generate a story at run time from atomic actions and without recourse to pre-scripted behaviors or story fragments. In this game, the player first acts out a plan to achieve a goal and then Glaive coordinates all the non-player characters in the game to thwart the player's plan. The game is evaluated relative to two other versions: a control in which the other characters do nothing and a scripted version in which the other characters are controlled by programs written by a human author. Players recognize intentionality and conflict in the stories Glaive produces more so than in the control and comparably to the human scripted version. In summary, this document describes how a narratological definition of conflict as thwarted plans has been operationalized in plan data structures and incorporated into a narrative planning algorithm. The knowledge representation is rich enough that a human audience recognizes thwarted plans where the model defines them to exist. The algorithm is fast enough to be used in a real time interactive context for certain non-trivial story domains. This work represents one small advancement toward understanding human storytelling and leveraging that understanding in interactive systems.},

We shift focus, considering agency, instead, as a phenomenon involving both player and game, one that occurs when the actions players desire are among those they can take (and vice versa) as supported by an underlying computational model. This shifts attention away from questions such as whether agency is “free will” (it is not) and toward questions such as how works evoke the desires agency satisfies, employ computational models in the service of player action and ongoing dramatic probability, use interfaces and mediation to encourage appropriate audience expectation, shift from initial audience expectation to an understanding of the computational model, and can be shaped with recognition of the inherently improvisational nature of agency. We focus particularly on agency in relation to the fictional worlds of games and other playable media.},

This disparity in underlying knowledge representations leads to a lack of common evaluation metrics across story generation systems, particularly around the creativity aspect of generators. This paper takes Skald, a re- construction of the Minstrel creative story generation system, and maps the representation to a formal narrative representation of Story Intention Graphs (SIG) proposed by Elson et al. This mapping facilitates the opportunity to expand the creative space of stories generated through imaginative recall in Minstrel while maintaining narrative complexity. We show that there is promise in using the SIG as an intermediate representation that is useful for evaluation of story generation systems.},

Moreover, Propp's thorough characterization of basic narrative constituents by explanations, discussions and examples of their different realizations in his corpus is utilized to construct an automatic classification model. A semi-automatic classification supports (i) authors to associate new scenes with basic narrative constituents and (ii) players to control the narrative flow in the story engine. For the latter task, the selection of an appropriate plot element and behavioral pattern within the dialog model in response to player interactions is controlled by similarities between stimuli and known realizations of basic narrative constituents or behavioral patterns. This approach tackles the main challenge of interactive drama - to balance interactivity and storyness.},

abstract = {This thesis describes new approaches to the formal modeling of narrative discourse. Al- though narratives of all kinds are ubiquitous in daily life, contemporary text processing techniques typically do not leverage the aspects that separate narrative from expository discourse. We describe two approaches to the problem. The first approach considers the conversational networks to be found in literary fiction as a key aspect of discourse coher- ence; by isolating and analyzing these networks, we are able to comment on longstanding literary theories. The second approach proposes a new set of discourse relations that are specific to narrative. By focusing on certain key aspects, such as agentive characters, goals, plans, beliefs, and time, these relations represent a theory-of-mind interpretation of a text. We show that these discourse relations are expressive, formal, robust, and through the use of a software system, amenable to corpus collection projects through the use of trained annotators. We have procured and released a collection of over 100 encodings, covering a set of fables as well as longer texts including literary fiction and epic poetry. We are able to inferentially find similarities and analogies between encoded stories based on the proposed relations, and an evaluation of this technique shows that human raters prefer such a measure of similarity to a more traditional one based on the semantic distances between story propositions.},

Just as the printing press and the cinema have promoted and enabled new kinds of storytelling, computers work as enablers of games, letting us play old games in new ways and allowing for new kinds of games that would not have been possible before computers. Juul presents a classic game model, which describes the traditional construction of games and points to possible future developments. He examines how rules provide challenges, learning, and enjoyment for players, and how a game cues the player into imagining its fictional world. Juul's lively style and eclectic deployment of sources will make {\textless}i{\textgreater}Half-Real{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of interest to media, literature, and game scholars as well as to game professionals and gamers.{\}}},

abstract = {Current approaches to authoring behavior and dialogue for agents that interact with humans in virtual environments are labor intensive, yet often yield less robust results than desired in the face of the incredible variance possible in human input. The growing number of people playing multiplayer games online provides a potentially better alternative to hand-authored content -- capturing behavior and dialogue from human-human interactions, and automating agents with this data. This paper documents promising results from the first iteration of a Collective Artificial Intelligence system that generates behavior and dialogue in real-time from data captured from over 11,000 players of The Restaurant Game . We first describe the game, the collective memory system, and the proposal-critique driven agent architecture, and then demonstrate quantitatively that our system preserves the texture , or meaningful local coherence, of human social interaction.},

A technique of memory representation based on plot units appears to provide a rich foundation for such an analysis. Plot units are conceptual structures that overlap with each other when a narrative is cohesive. When overlapping intersections between plot units are interpreted as arcs in a graph of plot units, the resulting graph encodes the plot of the story. Structural features of the graph then reveal which concepts are central to the story, and which concepts are peripheral. Plot unit analysis is currently being investigated as a processing strategy for narrative summarization by both computer simulation and psychological experiments.},

Because it uses autonomous agents, the drama is highly replayable: you can play the same story from multiple perspectives, or assign different characters to the various roles. The architecture relies on the notion of a social practice to achieve coordination between the independent autonomous agents. A social practice describes a recurring social situation, and is a successor to the Schankian script. Social practices are implemented as reactive joint plans, providing affordances to the agents who participate in them. The practices never control the agents directly; they merely provide suggestions. It is always the individual agent who decides what to do, using utility-based reactive action selection.},

abstract = {Narratives are perhaps the most effective way to convey to new generations the traditions, knowledge and morals of a culture. They are often used to influence present and future beliefs, as well as cultural norms. One present-day example is the spin placed on reports of the same events by different news outlets — contrast Al Jazeera and the New York Times — that serve to inflame opposing passions of the Arab and Western world. Consider also the history textbooks given to Israeli and Palestinian children, which differ significantly in their accounts of those peoples (Bar-On {\&} Adwan 2006). Analyzing these phenomena by building formal models is an important step toward understanding how members of a culture might reason about the impact of internal and external events and actions, and therefore eventually mitigating and controlling the negative effects. Surprisingly, given the 50-year history of Artificial Intelligence, there have been few research programs that have investigated narrative itself from a computational viewpoint. This first workshop on computational approaches to understanding narrative had three main objectives: (1) Evaluate the “state-of the art” in modeling narrative (2) Explore the scope and dimensions of narrative itself (3) Begin to build a community focused on computational narrative.},

abstract = {"Interactive Cinema" is a term that has been associated with videogames within historical media discourse, particularly since the early nineties due to the proliferation of CD-ROM technology. It is also a fundamental misnomer, since the processes of experiential engagement presented by the textual structures of videogames and cinema are mutually exclusive. The experience of cinematic texts is defined, in part, by the audience's lack of ability to alter events unfolding within the film's diegesis. In comparison, the experience of videogames is tied inextricably to the player's investment and involvement within the game's textual diegesis, and within a Heideggerian world-of-concern. However, there has been a recent development that suggests a bridge between these two structures: texts which are less defined by their ludic qualities than by a set structure - but where the affective qualities of the experience rely entirely on the direct involvement of the person engaging with the text. These are a storytelling form which are neither "played" or "watched," and it may be that "interactive cinema" is an appropriate way of conceptualising these experiences. {\textcopyright} 2001 - 2012 Game Studies.},

For the better part of a decade, Flash was the de facto standard for dynamic online media, empowering amateur and professional developers to shape the future of the interactive Web. In this book, Anastasia Salter and John Murray trace the evolution of Flash into one of the engines of participatory culture. Salter and Murray investigate Flash as both a fundamental force that shaped perceptions of the web and a key technology that enabled innovative interactive experiences and new forms of gaming. They examine a series of works that exemplify Flash's role in shaping the experience and expectations of web multimedia. Topics include Flash as a platform for developing animation (and the "Flashimation" aesthetic); its capacities for scripting and interactive design; games and genres enabled by the reconstruction of the browser as a games portal; forms and genres of media art that use Flash; and Flash's stance on openness and standards--including its platform-defining battle over the ability to participate in Apple's own proprietary platforms. Flash's exit from the mobile environment in 2011 led some to declare that Flash was dead. But, as Salter and Murray show, not only does Flash live, but its role as a definitive cross-platform tool continues to influence web experience.},

abstract = {With Storytelling and the Science of Mind, David Herman proposes a cross-fertilization between the study of narrative and research on intelligent behavior. This cross-fertilization goes beyond the simple importing of ideas from the sciences of mind into scholarship on narrative and instead aims for convergence between work in narrative studies and research in the cognitive sciences. The book as a whole centers on two questions: How do people make sense of stories? And: How do people use stories to make sense of the world? Examining narratives from different periods and across multiple media and genres, Herman shows how traditions of narrative research can help shape ways of formulating and addressing questions about intelligent activity, and vice versa.Using case studies that range from Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde to sequences from The Incredible Hulk comics to narratives told in everyday interaction, Herman considers storytelling both as a target for interpretation and as a resource for making sense of experience itself. In doing so, he puts ideas from narrative scholarship into dialogue with such fields as psycholinguistics, philosophy of mind, and cognitive, social, and ecological psychology. After exploring ways in which interpreters of stories can use textual cues to build narrative worlds, or storyworlds, Herman investigates how this process of narrative worldmaking in turn supports efforts to understand -- and engage with -- the conduct of persons, among other aspects of lived experience.},

While techniques such as in media res, flashbacks, and flash-forwards have been used since ancient times, these techniques have been extensively used in several movies in the past two decades. Such movies keep the viewers interested even aſter they leave the theatre, and lead to several in-person and online discussions. This paper highlights how data visualization can also help extend the movie experience and aid in discussions around the narrative. Apart from letting users relive special moments from a movie, such a visualizations can also summarize the overall structure and timing of the non-linear narrative, and explore cues and elements of continuity used. For the purpose of demonstration, this paper uses the non-linear narrative of the movie (500) Days of Summer (2009) to create an interactive data visual- ization using the D3.js JavaScript library.},

abstract = {The field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation is one of the oldest in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which is hardly surprising, since storytelling is such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and social activity. In recent years, the demands of interactive entertainment and interest in the creation of engaging narratives with life-like characters have provided a fresh impetus to this field. This book provides an overview of the principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in modeling the narrative structure of stories. The book introduces classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their mapping to computational approaches. It demonstrates how research in AI and NLP has modeled character goals, causality, and time using formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning, and temporal reasoning, and discusses fundamental limitations in such approaches. It proposes new representations for embedded narrati es and fictional entities, for assessing the pace of a narrative, and offers an empirical theory of audience response. These notions are incorporated into an annotation scheme called NarrativeML. The book identifies key issues that need to be addressed, including annotation methods for long literary narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and characterizing the goals of narrators. It also suggests a future characterized by advanced text mining of narrative structure from large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of useful authoring aids. This is the first book to provide a systematic foundation that integrates together narratology, AI, and computational linguistics. It can serve as a narratology primer for computer scientists and an elucidation of computational narratology for literary theorists. It is written in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a broad scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and formal semanticist ), AI researchers, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.

abstract = {Games with a strong notion of story are increasingly popular. With the increased amount of story content associated with games where player decisions significantly change the course of the game (branching games), comes an increase in the effort required to author those games. Despite the increased popularity of these kinds of games, it is unclear if a typical player is able to appreciate the rich content of these games, since any given player typically only experiences a small amount of that con- tent. We create a non-branching game that simulates branching choices by providing players with choices followed by immediate textual feed- back. We hypothesize that this game, where player decisions do not significantly change the course of the game, will maintain the player's sense of agency. Experimentation showed that in a text-based story with forced-choice points there were in most cases no significant difference in players' reported feelings of agency when they experience a branching story vs. a linear story with explicit acknowledgement of their choices.},

@phdthesis{Mateas2002b,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence methods open up new possibilities in art and entertainment, enabling rich and deeply interactive experiences. At the same time as AI opens up new fields of artistic expression, AI-based art itself becomes a fundamental research agenda, posing and answering novel research questions that would not be raised unless doing AI research in the context of art and entertainment. I call this agenda, in which AI research and art mutually inform each other, Expressive AI. Expressive AI takes seriously the problem of building intelligences that robustly function outside of the lab, engaging human participants in intellectually and aesthetically satisfying interactions, which, hopefully, teach us something about ourselves. This thesis describes a specific AI-based art piece, an interactive drama called Fa{\c{c}}ade, and describes the practice of Expressive AI, using Fa{\c{c}}ade, as well as additional AI-based artwork described in the appendices, as case studies. An interactive drama is a dramatically interesting virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, within which the player experiences a story from a first person perspective. Over the past decade, there has been a fair amount of research into believable agents, that is, autonomous characters exhibiting rich personalities, emotions, and social interactions. There has been comparatively little work, however, exploring how the local, reactive behavior of believable agents can be integrated with the more global, deliberative nature of a story plot, so as to build interactive, dramatic worlds. This thesis presents Fa{\c{c}}ade, the first published interactive drama system that integrates character (believable agents), story (drama management) and shallow natural language processing into a complete system. Fa{\c{c}}ade will be publicly released as a free download in 2003. In the Fa{\c{c}}ade architecture, the unit of plot/character integration is the dramatic beat. In the theory of dramatic writing, beats are the smallest unit of dramatic action, consisting of a short dialog exchange or small amount of physical action. As architectural entities, beats organize both the procedural knowledge to accomplish the beat's dramatic action, and the declarative knowledge to sequence the beat in an evolving plot. Instead of conceiving of the characters as strongly autonomous entities that coordinate to accomplish dramatic action through purely local decision-making, characters are instead weakly autonomous – the character's behavioral repertoire dynamically changes as beats are sequenced. The Fa{\c{c}}ade architecture includes ABL (A Behavior Language), a new reactive planning language for authoring characters that provides language support for joint action, and a drama manager consisting of both a language for authoring the declarative knowledge associated with beats and a runtime system that dynamically sequences beats. Fa{\c{c}}ade is a collaboration with independent artist and researcher Andrew Stern. Expressive AI is not the “mere” application of off-the-shelf AI techniques to art and entertainment applications. Rather, Expressive AI is a critical technical practice, a way of doing AI research that reflects on the foundations of AI and changes the way AI is done. AI has always been in the business of knowing-by-making, exploring what it means to be human by building systems. Expressive AI just makes this explicit, combining the thought experiments of the AI researcher with the conceptual and aesthetic experiments of the artist. As demonstrated through Fa{\c{c}}ade and the other systems/artworks described in the appendices, combining art and AI, both ways of knowing-by-making, opens up new research questions, provides a novel perspective on old questions, and enables new modes of artistic expression. The firm boundary normally separating “art” and “science” is blurred, becoming two components of a single, integrated practice.},

While platform studies has its critics, who primarily lament the limitations of the project, a recent spate of pub-lications in the field suggests considerable dynamism in platform studies as the concept is further developed. This article argues that by examining platform studies from the perspective of media archaeology, it becomes apparent that platform studies establishes an ''epistemic threshold''. Additionally, platform studies is a his-torical method which both establish continuities and mark breaks with previous platforms and technologies. From the perspective of this threshold, this article explores epistemic questions that arise from how platform studies forms an archive, and how media archaeology can enrich the method's explicit concerns and engagements with technology and culture.},

abstract = {The rise of the interactive story over the past few decades has presented the- orists and authors with a number of significant conceptual challenges, among the most foundational of which is the question of how to produce compelling experi- ences with nondeterministic and participatory narratives. While some preliminary attempts at creating taxonomies to catalogue the space of interactive stories have been advanced, there is still a confusion in both terminology and practice of what to call and how to understand the interactive story. I propose to define a particular subset of interactive story which I find most fascinating, the story system, a machine that enacts an ergodic multi-form story using procedures to both vary the narrative and encourage complete traversals. I profile several existing story systems, includ- ing 1893: A World's Fair Mystery, Echo Bazaar, and Balance of Power: 21st Cen- tury. I then discuss a set of experimental interactive narratives I created or helped author content for as part of my MFA thesis work, discussing both how they func- tion in relation to existing paradigms such as interactive fiction and hypermedia, and how they relate to the new concept of the story system. Several insights arose out of these experiments, including the concept of quantum authoring, where au- thors must keep a number of possible story states superimposed in their heads while creating content, and the need for better tools and high-level systems for authoring and managing procedurally narrative stories.},

abstract = {What Is Your Quest? examines the future of electronic literature in a world where tablets and e-readers are becoming as common as printed books and where fans are blurring the distinction between reader and author. The construction of new ways of storytelling is already underway: it is happening on the edges of the mainstream gaming industry and in the spaces between media, on the foundations set by classic games. Along these margins, convergent storytelling allows for playful reading and reading becomes a strategy of play. One of the earliest models for this new way of telling stories was the adventure game, the kind of game centered on quests in which the characters must overcome obstacles and puzzles. After they fell out of fashion in the 1990s, fans made strenuous efforts to keep them alive and to create new games in the genre. Such activities highlight both the convergence of game and story and the collapsing distinction between reader and author. Continually defying the forces of obsolescence, fans return abandoned games to a playable state and treat stories as ever-evolving narratives. Similarly, players of massive multiplayer games become co-creators of the game experience, building characters and creating social networks that recombine a reading and gaming community. The interactions between storytellers and readers, between programmers and creators, and among fans turned world-builders are essential to the development of innovative ways of telling stories. And at the same time that fan activities foster the convergence of digital gaming and storytelling, new and increasingly accessible tools and models for interactive narrative empower a broadening range of storytellers. It is precisely this interactivity among a range of users surrounding these new platforms that is radically reshaping both e-books and games and those who read and play with them.},

@phdthesis{ClaraFernandez-Vara2009,
abstract = {This dissertation aims at positioning adventure games in game studies, by describing their formal aspects and how they have integrated game design with stories. The adventure game genre includes text adventures (also known as interactive fiction), graphical text adventures, and graphic adventures, also referred to as point-and-click adventure games. Adventure games have been the first videogames to evidence the difficulty of reconciling games and stories, an already controversial topic in game studies. An adventure game is a simulation, the intersection between the rule system of the game and its fictional world. The simulation becomes a performance space for the player. The simulation establishes how the player can interact with the world of the game. The simulated world integrates a series of concatenated puzzles, which structure the performance of the player. Solving the puzzles thus means advancing in the story of the game. The integration of the story with the simulation is done through the performance of the player. The game design establishes a specific set of actions necessary to complete both the game and the story, and this set of actions constitutes a behavior that must be restored through performance. The player can also explore the world and its workings, which is necessary to solve the puzzles. By solving the puzzles, the player restores this pre-set behavior. The simulation in adventure games may not be evident because of a historical shift in the level of abstraction, which determines how the world is implemented in the game mechanics. Adventure games have increasingly curbed the agency of the player in the world, in order to facilitate completing the story of the game. This move to a less fine-grained interaction has affected different aspects of game design, from reducing the number of possible actions to limiting the interactivity of non-player characters. The dissertation discusses how adventure games have integrated story with the performance in the simulated world of the game. This integration is further evidenced by how they apply to the four basic elements that bridge story and game design: space, player character, non-player character and time. The qualities of these elements help us understand how the player performs in the simulation, and how that performance is designed. Analyzing the properties of the simulation in adventure games helps draw comparisons with other videogame genres. The rich history of adventure games can inform the game design of other videogames, particularly in relation to the creation of fictional worlds, strategies to script the interactor, and design of non-player characters.},

The NARRATIVE THEATRE consists of a rich writing interface, a robust natural language processor, a narrative reasoner, and a storyboard generator.

More common are the extended CGs, which are a typed superset of the core. The research CGs have explored novel techniques for reasoning, knowledge representation, and natural language semantics. The semantics of the core and extended CGs is defined by a formal mapping to and from ISO standard 24707 for Common Logic, but the research CGs are defined by a variety of formal and informal extensions.

abstract = {Is there a significant difference between engagement with a game and engagement with a movie or novel? Can interactivity contribute to immersion, or is there a trade-off between the immersive "world" aspect of texts and their interactive "game" dimension? As Marie-Laure Ryan demonstrates in Narrative as Virtual Reality 2, the questions raised by the new interactive technologies have their precursors and echoes in pre-electronic literary and artistic traditions. Approaching the idea of virtual reality as a metaphor for total art, Ryan applies the concepts of immersion and interactivity to develop a phenomenology of narrative experience that encompasses reading, watching, and playing. The book weighs traditional literary narratives against the new textual genres made possible by the electronic revolution of the past thirty years, including hypertext, electronic poetry, interactive drama, digital installation art, computer games, and multi-user online worlds like Second Life and World of Warcraft.In this completely revised edition, Ryan reflects on the developments that have taken place over the past fifteen years in terms of both theory and practice and focuses on the increase of narrativity in video games and its corresponding loss in experimental digital literature. Following the cognitive approaches that have rehabilitated immersion as the product of fundamental processes of world-construction and mental simulation, she details the many forms that interactivity has taken—or hopes to take—in digital texts, from determining the presentation of signs to affecting the level of story.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents theoretical and technical support for, and implementations of, narrative computational media works with the following characteristics: generative content, semantics- based interaction, reconfigurable narrative structure, and strong cognitive and socio-cultural grounding. A system that can dynamically compose media elements (such as procedural computer graphics, digital video, or text) to result in new media elements can be said to generate content. The GRIOT system, a result of this dissertation, provides an example of this. It has been used to implement computational poetry that generates new narrative poems with varying particular concepts, but fixed themes, upon each execution. This generativity is enabled by the Alloy system, which implements an algorithm that models key aspects of Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner's theory of conceptual blending. Alloy is the first implementation of Joseph Goguen's algebraic semiotics approach to blending. (Fauconnier {\&} Turner, 2002; Goguen, 1998) This research also contributes to the theory of algebraic semiotics by developing a blending-based notion of style. Semantics- based interaction means here that (1) media elements are structured according to the meaning of their content, and (2) user interaction can affect content of a computational narrative in a way that produces new meanings that are constrained by the system's author. "Meaning" in this case indicates that the author has provided formal descriptions of domains and concepts pertinent to the media elements and subjective authorial intent. Meaning can also be reconfigured at the level of narrative discourse. The formal structure of a computational narrative can be dynamically restructured, either according to user interaction, or upon execution of the system as in the case of narrative generation. Strong cognitive and socio- cultural grounding here implies that meaning is considered to be contextual, dynamic, and embodied. The formalizations used derive from, and respect, cognitive linguistics theories with such notions of meaning. Furthermore, the notion of narrative here is not biased toward one particular cultural model. Using semantically based media elements as a foundation, a cultural producer can implement a range of culturally specific or experimental narrative structures},

abstract = {Cognitive approaches have been widely hailed as “the next big thing” in the beleaguered field of literary studies. But despite a widespread interest for what narrative means for the life of the mind, the significance of the concrete contributions of the so-called cognitive sciences to narratology is far from enjoying broad acknowledgment. In this paper I propose a critical examination of the various approaches to narrative that can be called “cognitive,” from hard scientific studies based on brain scanning, to psychological experiments that test the reaction of subjects to simple texts composed specially for the occasion, to the import of concepts from the more speculative disciplines of the cognitive sciences, such as social psychology or philosophy of mind. I distinguish three areas of investigation for cognitive narratology: (1) the minds of characters; (2) the mental activity of the reader (spectator, player, etc); (3) narrative as a way of thinking. Against the tendency to conceive cognitive narratology as a matter of borrowing ready-made concepts from the cognitive sciences and applying them top-down to texts, I argue in favor of trusting the ability of our own minds to figure out how the mind creates, decodes and uses stories.},

@article{Mateas2009b,
abstract = {Much analysis of games focuses, understandably, on their mechanics and the resulting audience experiences. Similarly, many genres of games are understood at the level of mechanics. But there is also the persistent sense that a deeper level of analysis would be useful, and a number of proposals have been made that attempt to look toward a level that undergirds mechanics. This paper focuses on a particular approach of this sortoperational logicsfirst proposed by Noah Wardrip-Fruin (2005) and since then discussed by authors such as Michael Mateas (2006) and Ian Bogost (2007). Operational logics connect fundamental abstract operations, which determine the state evolution of a system, with how they are understood at a human level. In this paper we expand on the concept of operational logics, offering a more detailed and rigorous discussion than provided in earlier accounts, setting the stage for more effective future use of logics as an analytical tool. In particular, we clarify that an operational logic defines an authoring (representational) strategy, supported by abstract processes or lower-level logics, for specifying the behaviors a system must exhibit in order to be understood as representing a specified domain to a specified audience. We provide detailed discussion of graphical and resource management logics, as well as explaining problems with certain earlier expansions of the term (e.g., to file handling and interactive fictions riddles).},

@book{Crawford1982,
abstract = {The central premise of this book is that computer games constitute a new and as yet poorly developed art form that holds great promise for both designers and players. This premise may seem laughable or flippant. How could anybody classify the likes of SPACE INVADERS and PAC MAN as art? How can TEMPEST or MISSILE COMMAND compare with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Michelangelo's Pieta, or Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms? Computer games are too trivial, too frivolous to be called art. They are idle recreation at best. So says the skeptic. But we cannot relegate computer games to the cesspit of pop culture solely on the evidence of the current crop of games. The industry is too young and the situation is too dynamic for us to dismiss computer games so easily. We must consider the potential, not the actuality. We must address the fundamental aspects of computer games to achieve a conclusion that will withstand the ravages of time and change. There are many definitions of art, few of which make much sense to the uninitiated. I will present my own pedestrian definition: art is something designed to evoke emotion through fantasy. The artist presents his audience with a set of sensory experiences that stimulates commonly shared fantasies, and so generates emotions. Art is made possible only by the richness of the fantasy world we share. Art is nevertheless difficult, because there are so many practical problems associated with stimulating fantasies deep inside another person's mind. A major problem is getting the attention or participation of the audience. Most art allows very little participation. You sit quietly and listen to music that other people created and perform, or you stroll through a museum and stare at pictures or statues other people made. You sit passively and read a novel, or a poem, or a short story. With all of these art forms, the role of the audience is passive. The artist does all the active work, makes the biggest emotional investment. The audience is expected to absorb quietly the fruits of the artist's exertions. Active participation is severely curtailed. Without participation, attention dwindles and impact crumbles away. This is in no wise a criticism of art or artists. The technologies of art preclude participation. If we had every klutz jump into the orchestra pit, or prance on the opera stage, or slop paint with Picasso, we would have some great parties but no art. it seems the curse of art that artists can say so much in their work and most people will hear so little because they cannot participate in the art. Enter the computer. Conceived long ago, born in war, reared as the servant of business, this now adolescent technology has exploded out of the computer room and invaded shopping centers, pizza parlors, and homes. Popular characterizations of the computer alternate between the old image of the computer as omniscient, cold blooded, giant calculator, and the new image of the computer as purveyor of video thrills and 25 cent fixes. Originally developed as a number cruncher, the computer assumed a new personality when it was given graphics and sound capabilities. These capabilities gave the computer a powerful asset: it could now communicate with the human, not just in the cold and distant language of digits, but in the emotionally immediate and compelling language of images and sounds. With this capability came a new, previously undreamed of possibility: the possibility of using the computer as a medium for emotional communication art. The computer game has emerged as the prime vehicle for this medium. The computer game is an art form because it presents its audience with fantasy experiences that stimulate emotion. Unfortunately, the current generation of microcomputers cannot produce a sensory experience as rich as that produced by, say, a symphony orchestra or a movie. This weakness is more than offset by a fundamental advantage lacking in most other art forms: a game is intrinsically participatory in nature. The artist has here a tool that is more subtly indirect than traditional art. With other art forms, the artist directly creates the experience that the audience will encounter. Since this experience is carefully planned and executed, the audience must somehow be prevented from disturbing it; hence, non participation. With a game, the artist creates not the experience itself but the conditions and rules under which the audience will create its own individualized experience. The demand on the artist is greater, for s/he must plan the experience indirectly, taking into account the probable and possible actions and reactions of the audience. The return is far greater, for participation increases attention and heightens the intensity of the experience. When we passively observe someone else's artistic presentation, we derive some emotional benefit, but when we actively participate in a game, we invest a portion of our own ego into the fantasy world of the game. This more sizable investment of participation yields a commensurately greater return of emotional satisfaction. Indeed, the role of participation is so important that many people derive greater satisfaction from participating in an amateur artistic effort than from observing a professional effort. Hence, games, being intrinsically participatory, present the artist with a fantastic opportunity for reaching people. Until now, games in general and computer games in particular have not been very impressive as art forms. The computer games especially are downright puerile. This is because the technology of computer games has been in the hands of technologists, not artists. These guys (and they are almost all male) can write beautiful operating systems, languages, linking loaders, and other technological wonders, but artistic flair has heretofore been treated as subordinate to technical prowess. Another contributor to the fecklessness of our current computer games is the timidity of the marketplace. These machines are new; the public is unfamiliar with them and the manufacturers are hesitant to press the public too hard too fast. We therefore opt to build inhibited little games pathetically whispering some trivial emotion. Truly intense emotions or situations such as pathos, ecstasy, majesty, rapture, catharsis, or tragedy intimidate use. We hide behind the defense that we are in the entertainment business, not the art business, but that defense only betrays a profound misunderstanding of art. Art can be starchily elitist, but good art can also be a foot stomping blast. Elitism arises from the intellectual content of art; impact springs from its emotional honesty. Fortunately, times are changing. Already, we see a backlash developing against computer games. It expresses itself in many ways: in ordinances against the placement of arcade games in some areas, in statements by educators denouncing the games, and in more vigilant regulation of children's game activities by parents. This backlash is viewed by smaller minded members of the industry with anxiety. More visionary thinkers watch the backlash with eager interest rather than defensiveness. The American people are telling us something here, something very important. It is imporant enough to them that they are willing to compromise their traditional reluctance to interfere with other people's business. While the arguments presented in public debates normally focus on formal issues such as delinquency from school, creation of large groups of rowdy teenagers, and so forth, the concerns expressed privately reflect a distaste for the games, a vague suspicion that the games are a waste of time. You can't fool all of the people all of the time; they are beginning to realize that the world of computer games is as yet a vast wasteland. Computer games are much like candy, comic books, and cartoons. All four activities provide intense or exaggerated experiences. Whether they use sugar, exclamation points, or animated explosions, the goal is the same: to provide extreme experiences. Children appreciate these activities because their novelty value is still strong. Adults, jaded by years of experience with such things, prefer diversions with greater subtlety and depth. We thus have the panoply of culinary achievement, the vast array of literature, and the universe of movies as the adult counterparts to candy, comic books, and cartoons. Yet, we have no adult counterpart to computer games. This deficit is pregnant with possibilities, for it suggests a momentous upheaval in computer game design. This developing revolution has nothing to do with the rapid technological developments of the last few years. While technological improvements will surely continue, we are no longer hampered primarily by the limitations of the hardware. Our primary problem is that we have little theory on which to base our efforts. We don't really know what a game is, or why people play games, or what makes a game great. Real art through computer games is achievable, but it will never be achieved so long as we have no path to understanding. We need to establish our principles of aesthetics, a framework for criticism, and a model for development. New and better hardware will improve our games, but it will not guarantee our artistic success any more than the development of orchestras guaranteed the appearance of Beethoven. We are a long way from a computer game comparable to a Shakespeare play, a Tchaikowsky symphony, or a Van Gogh self portrait. Each of these artists stood on the shoulders of earlier artists who plunged into an unexplored world and mapped out its territories so that later artists could build on their work and achieve greater things. We computer game designers must put our shoulders together so that our successors may stand on top of them. This book is my contribution to that enterprise.},

abstract = {From the Publisher: In this important contribution to narrative theory, Marie-Laure Ryan applies insights from artificial intelligence and the theory of possible worlds to the study of narrative and fiction. For Ryan, the theory of possible worlds provides a more nuanced way of discussing the commonplace notion of a fictional "world," while artificial intelligence contributes to narratology and the theory of fiction directly via its researches into the cognitive processes of texts and automatic story generation. Although Ryan applies exotic theories to the study of narrative and fiction, her book maintains a solid basis in literary theory and makes the formal models developed by AI researchers accessible to the student of literature. The first part of the book seeks a more sophisticated application of the theory of possible worlds to the definition of fictionality. While fiction is a mode of travel into textual space, narrative is a journey within the confines of this space. The second part introduces the idea of a semantic domain consisting of a plurality of alternate possible worlds. This notion is developed into a theory of narrative conflict, which leads to an account of the forward movement of plot. By combining the philosophical back ground of possible world theory with models inspired by AI, the book fulfills a pressing need in narratology for new paradigms and an interdisciplinary perspective.},

abstract = {This paper surveys representation and processing theories arising out of conceptual dependency theory. One of the primary characteristics of conceptual dependency was the notion of a canonical form, built out of a small number of primitive representations. Although the notion of primitives has largely been lost in subsequent work, many other of the basic notions of CD have remained. In particular, the idea of building representations around inferential capabilities has prevailed in this family of research. The result is {\&}set of representational structures, all of which are highly knowledge intensive. The use of these structures in various processing theories has led to knowledge-based theories of understanding, planning, reasoning and other tasks which have contrasted sharply with the traditional search-oriented approaches used in other systems.},

abstract = {Interactive fiction can be understood and improved using concepts from narratology. Particularly useful is the idea that the discourse, or expression plane, can be considered separately from the underlying story, or content plane. While this sort of correspondence suggests many ways to improve IF and to achieve narrative variation, IF systems have yet to incorporate this distinction. An architecture that is based on this distinction, and that abstracts the simulated from the narrated, is presented. A preliminary system, implemented based on this architecture, is then described. Examples of some sorts of narrative variation this system can accomplish are provided.},

@article{Thue2011,
abstract = {Agency, being one's ability to perform an action and have some influence over the world, is fundamental to interactive entertainment. Although much of the games industry is concerned with providing more agency to its players, what seems to matter more is how much agency each player will actually perceive. In this paper, we present a computational model of this phenomena, based on the notion that the amount of agency that one perceives depends on how much they desire the outcomes that result from their decisions. Using a structure for high-agency stories that we designed specifically for this intent, we present the results of a 141-participant user study that tests our model's ability to select subsequent events in an original interactive story. Using a newly validated survey instrument for measuring both agency and fun, we found with a high degree of confidence that event sequences selected by our model result in players perceiving more agency than players who experience event sequences that our model does not recommend.},

@article{mateas2001preliminary,
abstract = {Interactive drama has been discussed for a number of years as a new AI-based interactive experience. While there has been substantial technical progress in building believable agents and some technical progress in interactive plot, no work has yet been completed that combines plot and character into a full-fledged dramatic experience. Part of the difficulty in achieving interactive drama is due to the lack of a theoretical framework guiding the exploration of the technological and design issues surrounding it. This paper proposes a theory of interactive drama integrating Laurel's Aristotelian structural model with Murray's concept of agency. The resulting theory illuminates the general conditions under which a user will experience agency in any interactive experience and provides design and technology guidance for the particular case of building interactive dramatic worlds.},
