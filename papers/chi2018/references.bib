               Player eXperience (PX) in video games. Video games have now
               become interactive entertainment systems with a high economic
               impact on society; these are interactive systems characterised
               by their subjectivity, which differ from other systems in that
               their main objective is to entertain and amuse the user
               (player). This work discusses the analysis and evaluation of the
               User eXperience (UX) in interactive entertainment systems,
               exploring how usability, given its definition, objectives and
               the fact it is one of the main dimensions of UX, is not
               sufficient to characterise the PX, giving rise to a new concept:
               Playability. In this paper, we present a framework for the
               analysis and evaluation of the UX in video games. The results
               show the need and importance of a framework to help us
               understand and measure the experience that players feel using
               these types of interactive systems, in order to improve the
               experience during play time. The proposed framework
               characterises the experience using attributes to identify and
               properties to measure UX. It thus provides a multifaceted
               analysis mechanism to assess the impact of the gaming experience
               and its relationship with the elements of a video game. We
               therefore present a system to represent UX based on this
               framework, with the aim of ensuring and measuring a satisfactory
               experience of the entertainment system. Finally, we discuss a
               practical experiment in which an evaluation of the playability
               of a commercial video game was carried out using the methods

              method for evaluating the technical and design approaches
              employed in a conversation-centered interactive drama. This
              method correlates players' subjective experience during

              we specifically focus on a single user interactive narrative

              responses to an interactive narrative called Fa??ade. We analyzed

               a cross-fertilization between the study of narrative and
               research on intelligent behavior. This cross-fertilization goes
               beyond the simple importing of ideas from the sciences of mind
               into scholarship on narrative and instead aims for convergence
               between work in narrative studies and research in the cognitive
               sciences. The book as a whole centers on two questions: How do
               people make sense of stories? And: How do people use stories to
               make sense of the world? Examining narratives from different
               periods and across multiple media and genres, Herman shows how
               traditions of narrative research can help shape ways of
               formulating and addressing questions about intelligent activity,
               and vice versa.Using case studies that range from Robert Louis
               Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde to sequences from The
               Incredible Hulk comics to narratives told in everyday
               interaction, Herman considers storytelling both as a target for
               interpretation and as a resource for making sense of experience
               itself. In doing so, he puts ideas from narrative scholarship
               into dialogue with such fields as psycholinguistics, philosophy
               of mind, and cognitive, social, and ecological psychology. After
               exploring ways in which interpreters of stories can use textual
               cues to build narrative worlds, or storyworlds, Herman
               investigates how this process of narrative worldmaking in turn

  abstract = "Recent years have seen an emerging interest in narrative-
              centered learning, ushering in a wave of research on adaptive
              story-based systems for education and training. Among the aims of
              current narrative-centered learning work is the creation of
              environments that draw students into the story while
              simultaneously satisfying pedagogical goals in an enjoyable,
              motivating, and effective manner. In this paper, we seek to
              characterize this interaction by introducing the notion of
              narrative presence and grounding the discussion in research on
              presence conducted in the human factors and virtual reality
              communities. Contributing factors to narrative presence are
              discussed in the context of CRYSTAL ISLAND, a testbed
              narrative-centered learning environment. Methods for subjective
              and objective evaluation of narrative presence are introduced and
              reviewed. Finally, the design implications of narrative presence
              for interactive narrative-centered learning environments are
              considered.",

              corpora for an wide variety of purposes. Unfortunately, software
              support for these corpora tends to be quite limited: it is
              usually ad-hoc, poorly designed and documented, or not released
              for public use. I describe an annotation tool, the Story

              It is free, open-source, cross-platform, and user friendly. It
              provides a number of common text annotation operations, including
              representations (e.g., tokens, sentences, parts of speech),
              functions (e.g., generation of initial annotations by algorithm,
              checking annotation validity by rule, fully manual manipulation
              of annotations) and tools (e.g., distributing texts to annotators
              via version control, merging doubly-annotated texts into a single
              file). The tool is extensible at many different levels, admitting

              to answer several interrelated questions: what corpora have been
              used in computational and cognitive research on narrative to
              date? What are the general characteristics of these corpora, and
              are they adequate for the overall task of a scientific
              understanding of narrative? What types of narratives have been
              studied, what kinds of annotations have been applied to those
              narratives, and what gaps need to be filled? To answer these
              questions, I conducted a wide-ranging literature review,
              collecting a bibliography of over 2600 conference papers, journal
              articles, theses, reports, and books on the topic of the

              corpora, and identified 167 unique text collections (155 with
              some sort of annotation) that could be considered a ``corpus''.
              These corpora were used in more than 180 publications across
              twelve fields. This set contained seventeen different broad types
              of narratives, five different modalities, and approximately 42

              due to its low discriminative power, Play- tracer’s usefulness is
              significantly decreased for games of even medium complexity, and
              is unusable on games with continuous state spaces. Here we show
              how the use of state features can remove both of these
              weaknesses. These state features collapse larger state spaces
              without losing salient information, resulting in visualizations
              that are significantly easier to interpret. We evaluate our work
              by analyzing player data gathered from three complex games in
              order to understand player behavior in the presence of optional
              rewards, identify key moments when players figure out the
              solution to the puzzle, and analyze why players give up and quit.
              Based on our experiences with these games, we suggest general
              principles for designers to identify useful features of game
              states that lead to effective play analyses.",

              narrative discourse. Al- though narratives of all kinds are
              ubiquitous in daily life, contemporary text processing techniques
              typically do not leverage the aspects that separate narrative
              from expository discourse. We describe two approaches to the
              problem. The first approach considers the conversational networks
              to be found in literary fiction as a key aspect of discourse
              coher- ence; by isolating and analyzing these networks, we are
              able to comment on longstanding literary theories. The second
              approach proposes a new set of discourse relations that are
              specific to narrative. By focusing on certain key aspects, such
              as agentive characters, goals, plans, beliefs, and time, these
              relations represent a theory-of-mind interpretation of a text. We
              show that these discourse relations are expressive, formal,
              robust, and through the use of a software system, amenable to
              corpus collection projects through the use of trained annotators.
              We have procured and released a collection of over 100 encodings,
              covering a set of fables as well as longer texts including
              literary fiction and epic poetry. We are able to inferentially
              find similarities and analogies between encoded stories based on
              the proposed relations, and an evaluation of this technique shows
              that human raters prefer such a measure of similarity to a more
              traditional one based on the semantic distances between story

              perceptions of the system well beyond the interface and its

                   emotion inform our work. Firstly, emotion is revealed not as
                   a quality in its own right but rather through interaction.
                   We study the 2-way relationship of Ilsa and Rick in the
                   movie Casablanca, and the 3-way relationship of Emma,
                   Charles and Rodolphe in the novel \{\textbackslashem Madame
                   Bovary\}. Secondly, emotion, that is expression of states of
                   mind of subjects, is formed and evolves within the narrative
                   that expresses external events and (personal, social,
                   physical) context. In addition to the analysis methodology
                   with key aspects that are innovative, the input data used is
                   crucial. We use, firstly, dialogue, and secondly, broad and
                   general description that incorporates dialogue. In a
                   follow-on study, we apply our unsupervised narrative mapping

  abstract = "This document describes a research approach that uses artificial
              intelligence (byway of a generative system) as a tool to explore
              the poetics of narrative choices (e.g., those found in
              Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books). Building on lessons learned
              from a rational reconstruction of Scott Turner’s Minstrel,
              Dunyazad is a novel system which generates narrative choices.
              Developed in tandem is a framework for analyzing choices based on
              player goals, as part of a broader theory of choice poetics. Two
              experiments involving human subjects have confirmed that Dunyazad
              is able to successfully generate a variety of choices, and both
              its successes and failures have informed the theory that drives
              it. The research questions addressed involve both computer
              science and poet- ics, namely: ``How can a computer automatically
              generate choices that achieve specific poetic effects?'' and
              ``What poetic effects can choices accomplish within a narrative
              and how can these be recognized by examining said choices?''
              Regard- ing the second question, chapter 5 outlines a broad
              theory of choice poetics which emphasizes the importance of
              player motivations. This theory asserts that in interactive
              narratives, choices are an essential part of poetic effects like
              trans- portation, agency, autonomy, responsibility, and regret. A
              method for analyzing choices relative to player goals is also
              developed, which includes discrete steps for understanding
              choices. By separating notions like player goals, outcome
              likelihoods, and option expectations, this goal-based choice
              analysis method aims to help dissect a player’s perception of a
              choice and give authors and critics a tool for talking about how
              choices work within a narrative. Regarding the first research
              question above, Dunyazad is a technical de- monstration that a
              direct operationalization of goal-based choice analysis can
              effectively generate narrative choices with specific low-level
              poetic effects, such as obviousness. Dunyazad uses answer-set
              programming to encode the inferences used in goal-based choice
              analysis as logical rules, and it can then solve for choices
              which meet criteria specified in terms of analytical labels like
              ``this choice is a dilemma.'' Because answer-set programming
              offers a direct path from theory to code, the choices that
              Dunyazad constructs can be understood in terms of the rules of
              goal-based choice analysis which enabled them. This last aspect
              is what allows Dunyazad to productively contribute back to the
              theory of choice poetics: when it generates a choice which
              doesn’t live up to the desired label, the answer set behind that
              choice serves as a proof that goal-based choice analysis would
              mis-characterize similar choices. Any unaccounted for aspects of
              that choice can then be noted as important considerations in the
              theory, and corresponding rules can be added to Dunyazad to alter
              its generative space. This process is amplified when the choices
              Dunyazad generates are evaluated not just by its author, but in
              an experimental setting. Accordingly, this document presents the
              results of two experiments involving 90 and 270 participants
              which looked at how choices generated by Dunyazad were perceived
              in terms of their options and outcomes. The results of these
              experiments confirmed Dunyazad’s ability to generate relaxed,
              obvious, and dilemma choices, as well as choices with both
              expected and surprising outcomes. However, Dunyazad was not
              exclusively successful, and its failures were informative,
              emphasizing the importance of moral reasoning in the case of
              conflicting goals and of relative goal analysis when judging
              whether options seem balanced or not. These results point to
              directions for improving the system, and these improvements
              correspond with further developments of the theory of choice
              poetics. In the broader context of research into generative
              systems, Dunyazad repre- sents both a system with a novel domain
              and a new application for a generative system. In following the
              rules laid out for it, Dunyazad makes no assumptions whatsoever,
              in contrast to the ‘common sense’ and myriad biases that a human
              would employ given the same instructions. Because of this, it
              acts as a check against these assumptions, regularly coming up
              with examples which violate them, and which thereby help
              elaborate the definitions of the underlying con- cepts that it is
              using. If Dunyazad’s goal was to persuade or entertain, these
              edge cases would be failures, but employed as a tool for
              reflection, they are suc- cesses, because they lead to a deeper
              understanding of choice poetics. Hopefully, Dunyazad is a
              convincing argument in favor of a new form of critical technical
              practice, where technical progress can be seen as not merely in
              need of critical contextualization but also as a tool that
              enables deeper critical insight.",

  abstract = "Using gameplay metrics to articulate player interaction within
              game systems has received increased interest in game studies. The
              value of gameplay metrics comes from a desire to empirically
              validate over a decade of theorization of player experience and
              knowledge of games as ludic systems. Taking gameplay metrics
              beyond formalized user testing (i.e. with the aim of improving a
              product) allows researchers the freedom of examining any
              commercially available game without the need to have access to
              the game's source code. This paper offers a new methodology to
              obtain data on player behavior, achieved through analyzing video
              and audio streams. Game interface features are being analyzed
              automatically, which are indicative of player behavior and
              gameplay events. This paper outlines the development of this
              methodology and its application to research that seeks to
              understand the nature of engagement and player motivations.",

  abstract = "Abstract Despite the word's common usage by gamers and reviewers
              alike, it is still not clear what immersion means. This paper
              explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can
              be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total.
              The first experiment investigated participants’ abilities to
              switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second
              experiment investigated whether there were changes in
              participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third
              experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace
              of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state
              anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings
              suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through
              questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye
              movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a
              positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e.
              anxiety) also run high.",
