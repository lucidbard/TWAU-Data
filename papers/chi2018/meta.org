Telling a story
Conflict. Some kind of decision, some question has to be answered. Then it has a meaning in terms of overall context.
How do you set this up as if this were a movie or novel.
Who would be the various roles?
What's the resolution of conflict?

Introduction:
- Think about answering 4 questions:
  - What's the real world problem we are trying to solve?
  - Why is it important to solve this problem?
  - What's the solution we came up with to solve the problem?
  - How do we know this is a good solution to the problem?

We try to solve problems. We carry out an evaluation of some
kind. Should show we've made important progress on the problem. 

They just haven't got a clear view of the problem they are trying to
solve. Only a few of them anyone would pay you to solve. 

The more work you can put into the front end, that you can convince
the reader that the things you do are valuable, the more leeway you'll
get.

They've set their first impressions in the first page.

Abstract is critical. Hope they read the introduction. Probably
willing to pay attention to the abstract. I'll go one step further --
title.

Title is the first opportunity to summarize why the paper should be accepted. 

Abstract is a slightly longer argument as to why you should accept the paper.

The introduction is a slightly longer argument.

All of these are opportunities to get something done.
