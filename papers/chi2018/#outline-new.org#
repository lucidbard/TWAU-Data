"Focus On Story: Using Narratological Lenses to Understand Player
Affective Response Data in Choice-Based Interactive Narratives"
** Abstract

* Outline
** Introduction
Game analytics has traditionally been composed of player observation

Game Telemetry has made possible data mining on actual player data,
and is useful in research and production contexts when studying a work
where you have access to source code.

Modern cinematic narrative games have much in common with film or
television, especially those created in the tradition of Telltale
games.

Kevin Bruner discusses using clustering techinques to understand
player data using Telltale's telemetry.

Some work on reuniting Narrative Analysis and Adventure games has been
done
(https://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/~vishnu/gameResearch/design/narrative.pdf)

We propose an alternative strategy to Telltale's: analyze player
experiences of existing released games for insights using a
combination of traditional qualitative and quantitative methods.

Our hypothesis is that by using narrative theory to sort the
experience data, the insights of different player reactions and
successful design examples can be gleaned from fewer samples than
those where statistical measures are available. 

There are really three things to analyze: The work itself, the
interaction of the work and the players, and the players themselves.

** Background
- Player Emotional Experience
  - Quantitative
    - Physiological Measures  (GSR, HR, etc)
    - Synthetic Telemetry data (Choice paths, content segments)
    - Frequency of self-report measures (thinkaloud, SEI)
  - Qualitative
    - Self-report retrospective
    - Questionaire (introducing questions specific to Character, Plot and Choice)
    - Interviews
- Narrative Theory, Story Craft & Computational Modeling of Narrative
  - Mateas used McKee's concept of a story "beat" to operationalize a
    theory of drama for Facade, using it to progress the dramatic
    tension while allowing a wide range of variable paths.
  - Finlayson worked to standardize corpus-based approaches with
    trained annotaters to create both automated and semi-automated
    machine understanding of story drawing from a history of success
    of the approach in Linguistics
  - Elson combined and improved on previous story models such as Plot
    Units to create a descriptive schemata applied successfully to
    detecting patterns in Aesop's Fables.
  - Mawhorter investigated the poetics of choice in interactive
    narratives in his dissertation work, again operationalizing and
    developing the theory at the same time.
** Goals and Approach
- The primary goal was to understand the relationships between
  player's emotional response and the narrative elements that gave
  rise to them. A secondary goal was to map objective metrics of the
  player experience and emotional response into the context of the
  story itself, even as the story varies for player to player. 
- And finally, what makes for a successful interactive narrative,
  ignoring for the moment the role of agency, immersion and production
  quality.
- We anticipated that player's emotional investment in the two
  penultimate story events would depend on their previous levels of
  engagement with the story, as represented by both their surfacing of
  emotional reports at certain points and by the amount they cared
  about the outcomes of their decisions, both in respect to the values
  represented as well as the characters themselves.
*** Study Design
- Chose Telltale Games' /The Wolf Among Us/ due to its critical
  acclaim, its independence from television franchises and the genre's
  integration of story and interaction.
- /The Wolf Among Us/ is a story about a divided community of refugees
  from a distant land whose identities correspond to fairy tales
  including Beauty and the Beast and the Big Bad Wolf. In this
  alternate reality New York, magic enables non-human Fables to pass
  amongst mundies (what the residents call normal people).
- Used a variety of instruments to measure player experience,
  including Robinson's All The Feels, Pre and Post Questionaires,
  Sensual Evaluation Instrument (SEI).
- Goal was to collect as many measures of emotional intensity as
  possible, physiological and non-verbal.
- An analysis of the traversals was made to break the content into
  scenes and beats, and to document choice options as well as
  selections
- Normalizing
  - Based on dramatic vs non-dramatic segment, each player's frequency
    of expression for each measure is normalized. This allows players
    to be compared more directly.
  - Further, in measures of emotional value, the different values are
    weighted with self-report (SEI, expressions) weighted less than
    heart rate spikes or skin conductivity spikes. Combining the two
    into a measure without access to more fine-grained heart rate
    variability is an open research question.
- A subset of beats and decisions were determined to be key and were
  selected due to their likelihood to trigger emotions or to influence
  the player's game experience. These were pulled out for comparison
  alongside choices and reaction datasets.
- Time windows and scope were critical -- what length of time relative
  to what event is of interest? Each beat was identified and then its
  start and ending time were annotated for each player, along with
  value(s) and character(s) involved. Individual story events were
  marked as individual annotations.
  - Choice Prompts -- determined that the minimum of either the time of the next choice prompt or 60 seconds
    - Needed to classify them into dramatic vs exposition
  - Story Events -- 90 seconds following a key event timepoint
  - Characters -- Any time during or 30 seconds following a beat has a character involved or referenced
  - Values -- Any time during or 30 seconds following a beat that has a tag of a value
*** Lenses
**** Choice

By examining the sequence of key choices against the overall player
affect, the influence of the choice on the outcome can become more
apparent. (Players that chose path A have this profile during these
scenes, Players that chose path B have this profile during this scene)

**** Value
As Robert McKee described, scenes turn on a value change. The values
in /The Wolf Among Us/ are Community/Self, Death/Life and
Justice/Loyalty. These permeate the world and are active in every
dramatically portrayed scene. By classifying beats according to the
values, the player's response to certain values can be measured.
**** Character
Certain characters may resonate more than others; Toad's plight as a
disadvantaged member of the community may be disguised by his acrid
air and haughty manners. Grendel's valid grievances are hidden behind
a wall of rage and disrespect. Faith and Snow both are sympathetic and
conflicted.
**** Plot
A mystery turns on information. Each detail progresses the interest,
from the discovery of the crime to the leads going down dead
ends. These elements define the plot and they stand out as singular
points.
** Results
[More on this]
- Emotional Map (regular boxes of each beat, alongside value and each player's emotional response during that beat)
beats 1-46


- Expressive profile of players (how likely are they to be detected by an affective measure, both during dramatic / QTE / non-dramatic segments)
- Sorting players by Value preference, Character preference, and Plot
  preference, with preference defined as a tendency to react after or in the window of each focus.
- Choice analysis -- distribution of choices and relation of key
  choices to the antecedent event/beats. 
** Discussion
- Measures provide an integrated map of intended effects and player responses
- Variety is good despite small sample size
- Combining measures eliminates some amount of noise, especially when normalized and grouped according to content model.
- More work can be done on modeling story elements using a formal model such as SIG
- Takeaway is to understand narrative forces in other games and critique their execution using such a method.
