\title{A Corpus-based Approach to \\Analyzing Player Experience in Interactive Digital Narratives}
\author{Removed for double blind

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

Contemporary interactive digital narratives combine interactivity, cinematic tropes and rich thematic writing. The content in such works is usually hand-authored, and the mechanics and instantial content designed to elicit particular player emotions and responses. Current computationally based analytical tools are focused on textual interactive narratives that are often created by the researchers themselves, and many investigate novel interactive storytelling mechanics and systems rather than pre-existing works. We argue that a corpus-based approach which is agnostic to a particular research goal would, as it has in linguistics, facilitate the quality of research into effects of interactive narratives. We have compiled an initial corpus using this approach by annotating gameplay and observational videos of players (n=7) experiencing the first episode of Telltale Games “The Wolf Among Us.” The player study uses multiple simultaneous measures to record a wide variety of input that isn’t immediately apparent from a log of the player choices alone, including the use of an instrument to facilitate player non-verbal report of emotions, the Sensual Evaluation Instrument \cite{Isbister2006-sc}. We have annotated the synchronized videos with choice identity, player-made decisions, and the player’s usage of the instrument. Our hypothesis was that multiple participants would converge on usage of the instrument at similar times in the narrative. Initial results, however, indicate that the work has elicited a much greater diversity of experiences than we could account for with the given measures.
