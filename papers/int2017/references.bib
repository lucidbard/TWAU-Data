                With the increased amount of story content associated with
                games where player decisions significantly change the course of
                the game (branching games), comes an increase in the effort
                required to author those games. Despite the increased
                popularity of these kinds of games, it is unclear if a typical

              narrative discourse. Al- though narratives of all kinds are
              ubiquitous in daily life, contemporary text processing techniques
              typically do not leverage the aspects that separate narrative
              from expository discourse. We describe two approaches to the
              problem. The first approach considers the conversational networks
              to be found in literary fiction as a key aspect of discourse
              coher- ence; by isolating and analyzing these networks, we are
              able to comment on longstanding literary theories. The second
              approach proposes a new set of discourse relations that are
              specific to narrative. By focusing on certain key aspects, such
              as agentive characters, goals, plans, beliefs, and time, these
              relations represent a theory-of-mind interpretation of a text. We
              show that these discourse relations are expressive, formal,
              robust, and through the use of a software system, amenable to
              corpus collection projects through the use of trained annotators.
              We have procured and released a collection of over 100 encodings,
              covering a set of fables as well as longer texts including
              literary fiction and epic poetry. We are able to inferentially
              find similarities and analogies between encoded stories based on
              the proposed relations, and an evaluation of this technique shows
              that human raters prefer such a measure of similarity to a more
              traditional one based on the semantic distances between story
              propositions.",

  abstract = "Interactive and personalized narrative -- two aspects of
              interactive storytelling -- are familiar as a pair of science
              fiction visions. The Holodeck, from Star Trek, imagines
              real-time, plot-defining interaction as a protagonist in an
              immersive virtual world. The Illustrated Primer, from Neal
              Stephenson’s The Diamond Age, instead imagines a computerized
              book which automatically writes custom, multimedia stories for
              its owner, indirectly contextualizing and commenting on the
              owner’s current life situation and challenges. Neither of these
              visions yet exists, and some believe that interactive
              storytelling is an inherently flawed concept. Nevertheless,
              interactive storytelling is experienced by many people every day.
              This is most common in computer games but is also experienced
              through a wide variety of other forms, from hypertext fictions to
              live performances. Researchers, designers, and authors continue
              to make progress by focusing on the specifics of particular
              fictional genres and tropes. This has produced a flowering of
              approaches and research directions, which are already indicating
              ways in which interactive storytelling will transform our key
              experiences of fiction. This chapter focuses on three of these
              experiences: empathy,curiosity, and responsibility. Empathy
              includes our experiences of identification, theory of mind, and
              social simulation with fictional characters. It is already
              changing as players, for example, struggle to complete gameplay
              challenges that mirror those of characters within a game’s
              fiction. It promises to shift further as it becomes possible to,
              for example, radically customize fictions to facilitate
              identification with particular characters. Curiosity includes our
              experiences of speculating about plot developments, character
              motivations, and the significance of fictional themes. It is
              already changing as interaction allows audiences to not only
              speculate but manipulate, investigate, and enact strategies
              within fictional worlds, receiving feedback that shapes their
              understandings of the world and what the fiction’s systems make
              possible. It promises to shift further as fictions are developed
              with a much wider range of possible audience actions and system
              responses within the key areas of fiction (rather than in the
              simulation of, e.g., physical movement or resource flows) and as
              fictions are able to actively reason about means of engaging
              audience curiosity. Responsibility is an experience that
              traditional fictions have struggled to create, with both
              radically experimental and traditional storytellers working to
              produce experiences that result in audiences reflecting on their
              own patterns of thoughts, actions, and complicity with the
              actions of others. Interactive experiences seem to promise an
              easy way to address this, because audiences choose and take
              actions. But we are only beginning to see this happening, as
              research efforts produce fictions that give audiences a broader
              range of meaningful choices within the key interpersonal action.
              Future developments in these areas are expected to produce
              fictions that are more emotionally engaging, that help us make
              sense of our lives, and even that contribute to positive behavior
              change -- necessitating the development of knowledge about the
              impacts of the powerful new art forms that emerge, as well as new
              ethics and aesthetics of interactive storytelling. A product of
              the convergence of computer science and the humanities, cognitive
              science and literature, engineering and art, new interactive and
              personalized approaches to narrative offer insights into future

               narrative stories. We present a fully automated system, called
               AESOP, that generates plot unit representations for narrative
               texts. AESOP performs four steps: affect state recognition,
               character identification, affect state projection, and link
               creation. We also identify a type of knowledge that seems to be
               missing from existing lexical resources: verbs that impart
               positive or negative polarity onto their patients (e.g., `` eat

               `` fed '' imparts positive polarity because being fed is good).

              situation models for narrative characters. In the first episode

              behaviors that allowed readers to construct trait inferences
              (e.g., Albert's shoes were ``buried under old candy wrappers,
              crumpled magazines, and some dirty laundry.''). Control stories
              omitted trait-relevant information. The second episode of each
              story gave readers an opportunity to apply the trait inference to
              generate expectations about story outcomes. In Experiment 1,
              participants agreed more readily to explicit outcomes that were
              consistent with their trait-based models. Experiment 2
              demonstrated that readers' expectations were narrowly defined by
              specific traits (e.g., Albert is sloppy) rather than by more
              general inferences (e.g., Albert is not a good person).
              Experiments 3 and 4 suggested that trait-based models have an

              case with facts, statistics, and some quotes from authorities. In
              other words, they resort to ``companyspeak,'' the tools of
              rhetoric they have been trained to use. In this conversation with
              HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known screenwriting lecturer,
              argues that executives can engage people in a much deeper--and
              ultimately more convincing--way if they toss out their
              Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell good stories. As
              human beings, we make sense of our experiences through stories.
              But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It requires imagination
              and an understanding of what makes a story worth telling. All
              great stories deal with the conflict between subjective
              expectations and an uncooperative objective reality. They show a
              protagonist wrestling with antagonizing forces, not a rosy
              picture of results meeting expectations--which no one ends up
              believing. Consider the CEO of a biotech start-up that has
              discovered a chemical compound to prevent heart attacks. He could
              make a pitch to investors by offering up market projections, the
              business plan, and upbeat, hypothetical scenarios. Or he could
              captivate them by telling the story of his father, who died of a
              heart attack, and of the CEO's subsequent struggle against
              various antagonists--nature, the FDA, potential rivals--to bring
              to market the effective, low-cost test that might have prevented
              his father's death. Good storytellers are not necessarily good
              leaders, but they do share certain traits. Both are self-aware,
              and both are skeptics who realize that all people--and

  abstract = "This document describes a research approach that uses artificial
              intelligence (byway of a generative system) as a tool to explore
              the poetics of narrative choices (e.g., those found in
              Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books). Building on lessons learned
              from a rational reconstruction of Scott Turner’s Minstrel,
              Dunyazad is a novel system which generates narrative choices.
              Developed in tandem is a framework for analyzing choices based on
              player goals, as part of a broader theory of choice poetics. Two
              experiments involving human subjects have confirmed that Dunyazad
              is able to successfully generate a variety of choices, and both
              its successes and failures have informed the theory that drives
              it. The research questions addressed involve both computer
              science and poet- ics, namely: ``How can a computer automatically
              generate choices that achieve specific poetic effects?'' and
              ``What poetic effects can choices accomplish within a narrative
              and how can these be recognized by examining said choices?''
              Regard- ing the second question, chapter 5 outlines a broad
              theory of choice poetics which emphasizes the importance of
              player motivations. This theory asserts that in interactive
              narratives, choices are an essential part of poetic effects like
              trans- portation, agency, autonomy, responsibility, and regret. A
              method for analyzing choices relative to player goals is also
              developed, which includes discrete steps for understanding
              choices. By separating notions like player goals, outcome
              likelihoods, and option expectations, this goal-based choice
              analysis method aims to help dissect a player’s perception of a
              choice and give authors and critics a tool for talking about how
              choices work within a narrative. Regarding the first research
              question above, Dunyazad is a technical de- monstration that a
              direct operationalization of goal-based choice analysis can
              effectively generate narrative choices with specific low-level
              poetic effects, such as obviousness. Dunyazad uses answer-set
              programming to encode the inferences used in goal-based choice
              analysis as logical rules, and it can then solve for choices
              which meet criteria specified in terms of analytical labels like
              ``this choice is a dilemma.'' Because answer-set programming
              offers a direct path from theory to code, the choices that
              Dunyazad constructs can be understood in terms of the rules of
              goal-based choice analysis which enabled them. This last aspect
              is what allows Dunyazad to productively contribute back to the
              theory of choice poetics: when it generates a choice which
              doesn’t live up to the desired label, the answer set behind that
              choice serves as a proof that goal-based choice analysis would
              mis-characterize similar choices. Any unaccounted for aspects of
              that choice can then be noted as important considerations in the
              theory, and corresponding rules can be added to Dunyazad to alter
              its generative space. This process is amplified when the choices
              Dunyazad generates are evaluated not just by its author, but in
              an experimental setting. Accordingly, this document presents the
              results of two experiments involving 90 and 270 participants
              which looked at how choices generated by Dunyazad were perceived
              in terms of their options and outcomes. The results of these
              experiments confirmed Dunyazad’s ability to generate relaxed,
              obvious, and dilemma choices, as well as choices with both
              expected and surprising outcomes. However, Dunyazad was not
              exclusively successful, and its failures were informative,
              emphasizing the importance of moral reasoning in the case of
              conflicting goals and of relative goal analysis when judging
              whether options seem balanced or not. These results point to
              directions for improving the system, and these improvements
              correspond with further developments of the theory of choice
              poetics. In the broader context of research into generative
              systems, Dunyazad repre- sents both a system with a novel domain
              and a new application for a generative system. In following the
              rules laid out for it, Dunyazad makes no assumptions whatsoever,
              in contrast to the ‘common sense’ and myriad biases that a human
              would employ given the same instructions. Because of this, it
              acts as a check against these assumptions, regularly coming up
              with examples which violate them, and which thereby help
              elaborate the definitions of the underlying con- cepts that it is
              using. If Dunyazad’s goal was to persuade or entertain, these
              edge cases would be failures, but employed as a tool for
              reflection, they are suc- cesses, because they lead to a deeper
              understanding of choice poetics. Hopefully, Dunyazad is a
              convincing argument in favor of a new form of critical technical
              practice, where technical progress can be seen as not merely in
              need of critical contextualization but also as a tool that
              enables deeper critical insight.",

@BOOK{Mani2012-py,
  title     = "Computational Modeling of Narrative",
  author    = "Mani, Inderjeet",
  abstract  = "The field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation
               is one of the oldest in natural language processing (NLP) and
               artificial intelligence (AI), which is hardly surprising, since
               storytelling is such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and
               social activity. In recent years, the demands of interactive
               entertainment and interest in the creation of engaging
               narratives with life-like characters have provided a fresh
               impetus to this field. This book provides an overview of the
               principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in
               modeling the narrative structure of stories. The book introduces
               classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their
               mapping to computational approaches. It demonstrates how
               research in AI and NLP has modeled character goals, causality,
               and time using formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning,
               and temporal reasoning, and discusses fundamental limitations in
               such approaches. It proposes new representations for embedded
               narrati es and fictional entities, for assessing the pace of a
               narrative, and offers an empirical theory of audience response.
               These notions are incorporated into an annotation scheme called
               NarrativeML. The book identifies key issues that need to be
               addressed, including annotation methods for long literary
               narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and
               characterizing the goals of narrators. It also suggests a future
               characterized by advanced text mining of narrative structure
               from large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of
               useful authoring aids. This is the first book to provide a
               systematic foundation that integrates together narratology, AI,
               and computational linguistics. It can serve as a narratology
               primer for computer scientists and an elucidation of
               computational narratology for literary theorists. It is written
               in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a broad
               scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and
               formal semanticist ), AI researchers, cognitive scientists,
               computer scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.
