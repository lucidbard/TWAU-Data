* ICIDS Requirements for Modeling Interactive Digital Narratives
Sole Authorship -- John Murray, Michael Mateas, Noah Wardrip-Fruin

*Brave New Ideas*

- Position Paper

Understand other minds, other ways of being, other combinatorics of
reality. To author with a digital assistant to help escape one's own
situation, to augment empathic experience and to anticipate the
effects of choices, opportunities, risks and rewards.

- Literature Survey of Computational Analytics + Modeling of Story, Story Understanding
  - Harmon
  - Elson
  - Finlayson
- Discourse Analysis
  - 
- Choice Poetics
  - Presenting Believable Choices (Justus Robertson, R. Michael Young)
  - 
 
- Compare Goals

** Motivation
  - Corpora of successful games annotated with opportunities &
  - Create a "Narrative Game Playing Bot"
    - Requires text processing, image analysis, input synthesis
    - Requires facial expression processing, story recognition,
      emotional simulation,
    - Has beliefs, atittudes toward particular topics.
    - How to classify player experiences -- positive, negative, what
      they reveal about the person.
    - Player Modeling + Feedback for Story Design
    - High Level Interactive Story Authoring Tools

** Requirements Analysis
  - Genre by Genre, as each set of game mechanics motivate a new
    coding schema
  - Example Genres that would be suitable, by Functional Game Mechanic
  - Narrative Coding Schema for Video Playthroughs
    - Uses Existing Story Intention Graphs
    - Problems with Annotating (Graphical Interface, etc)
** Challenges
*** How to uniquely identify choice (within a possible set of choices)
Can't give a choice an ID.

* ICIDS: Analyzing Causes of Player Emotions During An Interactive Narrative
- Describe Study Design, Data Set and Procedure
- Discuss emotion, narrative causes for emotions, and results
- Show diagrams of key moments and player decisions that preceded them
  - By understanding which decisions were associated with the values,
    the emotion can be better understood.
- Player Attitude toward topics, characters and the work shifts over time
- Players understand propositions and react to them. They anticipate
  them, and they react to them.
- Timing plays a critical but often hard to handle role. Distance
  between an emotional trigger and the payoff may affect the strength
  of an emotion. Linear film often controls this presentation
  completely, but interactive narratives introduce periods where the
  user can spend longer or shorter periods of time.

* CHI contributions

* INT Contributions
- Graph Algorithm input: 
  - 
recognize

* Outstanding theoretical problems:

1. How do you link story points between traversals?
  - Which decisions influenced the current content?
  - Which story points (causally) led to the current content?
  - What kind of story event took place?

2. How do you label segments/choices/etc that are identical between the two?
  - Fingerprint each playthrough
  - Choices represent various values (player-chosen)
  - Choices can be tagged with player-values, player-intents and
    player-identification
